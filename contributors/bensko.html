              art has gone through many stages she has enjoyed the hell out of: 
              woodcuts, monoprints, paintings, at first, and now predominantly 
              photographic art giclees and mixed media. She makes sculptural icons 
              and lamps with metals and photographs, illustrates the informative 
              magazine MKzine, does cd and book covers, published her art in magazines, 
              such as Raven's Quarterly, and shows in galleries and other venues 
              internationally, as with Art Points, in Spain, currently. Her art 
              has won awards such as at Mondial in Luxembourg, and Best of Show 
              at Art on the Lake, and the BTF Design Award, out of Italy, for 
              which she is a juror this year. She was the World Class Photographer 
              of January 2003 in The Times Journal of Photography, from India, 
              for which she also wrote three tutorials, featuring her art. That 
              magazine is one of a few that has run excellent interviews with 
              her. She has had an ungodly number of her pieces pubished, such 
              as in reputable online magazines, such as her feature in Pedestal 
              Magazine. She once ran an art gallery in Montevallo, Alabama, with 
              two other people, and she has written small books illustrated with 
              her art, published by the Laugh of God press, as well as editing 
              a magazine published by the same press, and her art ran freely through 
              all those pages, years ago. She has lived in many places, is a bit 
              of a vagabond, and loves to live wild and unencombered by civilization. 
              She also has times of embracing civilization to the hilt, and living 
              in big cities, and being part of the creative scene. Atlanta, and 
              Vancouver have been most kind to her that way. Mountains in Colorado, 
              canyons in Utah and Arizona, have been most kind to her in the uncivilized 
              part of her existence. She is a lover of surreal films, and has 
              participated in several such, most comedic, which is her best idea 
              of a good time. She also loves to sing or recite her poetry with 
              improvisational musicians, learn everything she can about the conspiracies 
              of this world, taught tantra yoga for many years, was a healer of 
              various sorts professionally for many others, was trained as a writer 
              with an MFA from Iowa and has published many works in magazines, 
              and has been a spiritual teacher for many. She is an eccentric person 
              who wants to learn to fly. Without a plane.</p>
