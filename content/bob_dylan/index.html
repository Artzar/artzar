        <img src="/content/bob_dylan/title.jpg" alt="How I Discovered I wasn't Bob Dylan by Carol W. Berman" width="272" height="220" border="0" align="left" usemap="#Map"><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">I 
        knew we were twins when I first saw Dylan's poster in the head shop on 
        Hollywood Boulevard last year in '68.</font> That long, pale, misshapen 
        face, the eyes narrowed by cigarette smoke, the full, chapped lips holding 
        the cigarette, his curly, unruly hair. He was glaring out from the photo 
        wearing an old, brown suede jacket. The shop was full of day-glow-painted 
        posters twinkling in the black lights. By the way the two freaks to my 
        left craned their necks at weird angles, gawking at the posters, I could 
        tell they were hallucinating their brains off. Not me, I was perfectly 
        straight that day, except for a few hits off a small joint.</font> 
      <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I'd never had a sister 
        or father that I knew of, but I had a twin. He was thirty years old. I 
        was a sixteen-year-old girl. Besides looking exactly like Dylan, I could 
        sing just like him. The most thrilling thing of all was that I would see 
        my twin live at the Hollywood Bowl in a week!</font> 
      <p align="center"><img src="/content/bob_dylan/div.gif" width="265" height="19"> 
      <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The day of the Dylan 
        concert all seven of us were crammed into the old Chevy we used for Driver's 
        Ed. Mr. Maley, the instructor, insisted on sitting up front, squeezed 
        between Sally and Tim, where the air-conditioning was the best. I was 
        in the back up against the door with Janine, Pedro and Bob to my right. 
        No one could escape my song in the tight space: "To be stuck inside of 
        Mobile with the Memphis bluu..es again..."</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Janine, that sick 
        motherfuck from Oklahoma next to me, stuck me in the ribs with her bony 
        elbow. "Shut up," she complained. "I can't stand to hear you wailing like 
        that."</font></p>
      <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"It's Dylan from 
        <i>Blonde on Blonde</i>. Don't you know anything?" I sneered. In school, 
        only the hippest kids knew of his existence. I was determined to join 
        that group to exclude Janine who always snubbed me. She was a Twiggy-shaped 
        blonde who wore the shortest miniskirts and strutted around school waving 
        her ass. The looks the guys gave her were sickening.</font></p>
      <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Pay attention," 
        Mr. Maley yelled. "As we enter the freeway, we speed up to blend with 
        traffic." He didn't want to get between me and Janine in our tenth fight 
        that semester. He ignored us.</font></p>
      <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The part where we 
        accelerated and zoomed into the pulsating lanes of traffic always gave 
        me a rush. Sally's knuckles turned white as she turned the steering wheel 
        just in time to miss sideswiping a red Jaguar convertible. We laughed 
        as hard as we could in the back seat.</font></p>
      <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"The ragman draws 
        circles up and down the block," I sang exuberantly to celebrate our survival.</font></p>
      <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Janine turned to 
        Pedro, who was so cute I almost couldn't bear to look at him. His white 
        teeth gleamed in beautiful contrast to his dark brown skin. His black 
        hair was in a Beatles' cut. "Did you ever have sex in the back seat of 
        a car?" she asked loudly, trying to drown me out. No wonder the guys drooled.</font></p>
      <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Yeah, man, all the 
        time," Pedro said. I knew he was lying by the way he grinned at her. I'd 
        never had sex yet, but I knew my twin was getting it on all the time. 
        Rock stars did nothing all day but have sex, shoot dope and sing according 
        to KFWB, my favorite radio station. I was hoping that that night my twin 
        and I would meet, face to face, and we would groove on each other completely.</font></p>
      <p align="center"><img src="/content/bob_dylan/div.gif" width="265" height="19"></p>
      <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Finally I was out 
        of that cramped car. At home I dropped the tab of acid I'd been thinking 
        about all day long. I lined up <i>Blonde on Blonde</i> and <i>Bringing 
        It All Back Home</i> to listen to while I tripped. When I came on to it, 
        the whole bedroom lit up as if a lightning bolt had struck. My dresser 
        which looked like a cube of solid honey melted onto the floor. I forced 
        myself out of bed to investigate. In the mirror I saw Bob Dylan. We had 
        merged to form one person: kind of like the positrons and electrons we'd 
        studied in physics - - only we didn't annihilate each other.</font></p>
      <p align="center"><img src="/content/bob_dylan/div.gif" width="265" height="19"></p>
      <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> It was 7 p.m. - 
        one hour before show time at the Hollywood Bowl. I pulled on my old brown 
        suede jacket I'd picked out at the thrift shop, like the one on <i>Blonde 
        on Blonde</i>. I messed up my hair even more and flew out the door. My 
        mother, who was too busy screwing her brains out with her various boyfriends 
        to ever miss me, certainly wouldn't that night; and I wouldn't have to 
        feel lonely or pissed off at her ever again, since I was Bob Dylan.</font></p>
      <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I went over to the 
        corner and stuck my thumb out towards heaven. A Volkswagen pulled over 
        after a few minutes. Inside a long-haired, older woman in wire-rimmed 
        glasses smiled and asked: "Where to?"</font></p>
      <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I'm going to my 
        concert at the Hollywood Bowl," I told her as I sank into the passenger 
        seat.</font></p>
      <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"What concert is 
        that?" she asked, glancing quickly at me. Was she dimwitted? Couldn't 
        she see I was Bob Dylan?</font></p>
      <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I narrowed my eyes. 
        "Dylan."</font></p>
      <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"He's playing tonight, 
        isn't he?" I could have told her, yeah, <i>I</i> was playing, but I thought 
        it was better for her to figure it out herself. While she was driving 
        she gave me some funny, sideways glances. Then I realized who <i>she</i> 
        was! She was the "sad-eyed lady of the lowlands." Imagine pretending not 
        to know me.</font></p>
      <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I bummed a cigarette, 
        so I could look more like my latest poster. Odd, that she didn't ask why 
        I was hitchhiking to my own concert. </font></p>
      <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Let me off here!" 
        I demanded. As she stopped the car, I asked: "You want my autograph?" 
        I was coughing from that unfiltered Camel she'd given me.</font></p>
      <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Why would I want 
        your autograph?" She turned to stare at me. Her eyes were like glass and 
        her mouth was mercury.</font></p>
      <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Thanks for the ride. 
        I'll remember you," I promised. I would play "Sad-eyed lady of the Lowlands" 
        for her.</font></p>
      <p align="center"><img src="/content/bob_dylan/div.gif" width="265" height="19"></p>
      <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> It was winter and 
        already dark. My suede jacket wasn't warm enough and I was shivering. 
        Four blocks more to the Hollywood Bowl. All I had to do was slip into 
        the Bowl through a back exit. I wondered if I was late. I didn't see the 
        black limo until it knocked me down. The car door opened. Light poured 
        out. The universe split apart as I lay there. The first thing I saw was 
        his black cowboy boots, then tight black jeans, the old, brown suede coat. 
        His pale face glowed and his cigarette smoldered.</font></p>
      <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Are you 0.K.? Aren't 
        you that groupie who gave me a turquoise belt buckle back in Tucson?" 
        he asked in his sexy, gravely voice.</font></p>
      <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I couldn't speak 
        because he'd already spoken, and how could I speak with a different mouth? 
        When the positron and electron came together, energy was released. Waves 
        of energy flowed between us.</font></p>
      <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Mr. Dylan, we must 
        get going. It's show time already!" a voice urged from inside the limo.</font></p>
      <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Hey, Joe, there's 
        a kid who looks just like me out here. We just ran her over," Dylan said.</font></p>
      <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I sat up. "It's 
        a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard rain is gonna fall," I sang.</font></p>
      <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"You like that song? 
        Come on, kid. You can sit backstage while I sing it." He grabbed my arm 
        and helped me into the limo. We both sank back into the soft leather seats 
        as we zipped off. I tried not to look at him as we rode: the paradox of 
        his presence was hard on my eyes.</font></p>
      <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> When the limo stopped, 
        I jumped out. As I climbed up the stairs to the stage door, I could hear 
        them announcing: "Ladies and Gentlemen, the one and only, Mr. Bob Dylan!" 
        I ran to center stage and grabbed the mike in front of the band playing 
        the intro to "Blowin' in the Wind." The blinding lights shone into my 
        eyes. I reveled at the universe which had given me back my twin self. 
        I opened my mouth to sing, absorbing the rush of vibes from the audience. 
        Two burly men from back stage ran towards me.</font></p>
