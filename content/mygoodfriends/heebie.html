            <P>Heebie was my spiritual adviser in London. Those were heady days. 
              I was employed by the wealthy financier by day and writing a screenplay 
              at night. The film's about a man who discovers that he has the power 
              to see into the future and the burden borne from such knowledge. 
              I began the script after an incident late one afternoon that sent 
              my psychic seams unraveling. I had been out for a stroll near Piccadilly 
              Circus when I saw a building on fire. No one around me seemed the 
              least disturbed. The bloody thing was absolutely raging. I spotted 
              a constable down the way. "That building looks tip top to me," he 
              said. "Move on, mate." I was simply another deranged American to 
              him. But the next morning there it was on the front page of The 
              Times. The building had caught fire in the middle of the night and 
              burned all to hell. Woah. I'd noticed a sign for psychic advisement 
              in a window a few days before and went there straight away. "Do 
              come in, M," said Heebie, before I'd spoken a word. She held her 
              hand close to her heart and stared at me for a long time before 
              speaking. "Psychic perturbations such as yours are initially very 
              unsettling. You've received a vibration from the Third Mind. You 
              may never receive it again or you may have this sort of thing happening 
              to you for the rest of your life. If you have further experiences 
              of this kind don't panic. Place your hand close to your heart just 
              as I am now. Let your heart embrace the experience." </P>
            <P>I'm still working on the script, The Man Who Saw Tomorrow. You 
              know me, the great procrastinator. Perhaps I'll finish it during 
              this underground sabbatical. And <i>not</i> destroy it. How refreshing 
              that would be. </P>
