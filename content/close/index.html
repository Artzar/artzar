            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Chuck Close's huge portraits 
              - paintings or collages or prints of the face, usually close-cropped 
              like a driver's license photo - hang in museums and galleries around 
              the world. Close started painting at age 6 and has never stopped. 
              His childhood art studies, growing up in Washington State, led to 
              graduate studies at Yale, where he emulated the brash, colorful 
              work of de Kooning. In 1967 Close found his own style in Big Self-Portrait, 
              a large, black and white photorealistic painting, followed by like 
              portraits of other people who were part of Close's own world: friends, 
              like composer Philip Glass and artist Richard Serra, and family 
              members. The portrait painting has never stopped, and neither has 
              Close's search for new techniques. In the late 1970s, Close found 
              color again and over the decades has put the spectrum through one 
              transformation after another - color dots, large and small, small 
              dots within large, three colors combined to make all colors (the 
              red-blue-yellow used in color printing), and countless colors combined 
              to make countless others. Color isn't just there in the tube for 
              Close; you make it on the canvas. And color isn't something you 
              plan in your head and then try to copy; you find color, through 
              the painting process itself. Form and line, too, are discovered. 
              Close starts with a photo, covers it with a grid, transfers the 
              grid, enlarged to scale, onto the big blank canvas, and then starts 
              in one corner, applying paint to the squares, repeating the process 
              in pass after pass from different angles. He makes no underlying 
              sketch to guide him; just the grid. The ears and eyes and locks 
              of hair appear only as the regions of hue and dark and light incrementally 
              coalesce into shapes. Now 61, Close continues finding new color 
              and new form through portraits of the people he knows and loves.

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I spoke with Chuck Close 
              on January 14th, 2002 in his downtown Manhattan art studio, a place 
              with a nondescript exterior that I had passed by many times before. 
              What amazing things can be going on, behind the brick walls and 
              shiny glass facades we see every day! The entry room was long and 
              deep but open, with a high ceiling and frosted windows which allowed 
              bountiful light. Along the left ran a long desktop area and above 
              that, a wall filled with books. From the right wall smiled a big 
              portrait of artist Robert Rauschenberg, composed of 4 large Iris 
              prints pieced together. Straight ahead through a large double doorway 
              was the studio itself: deep, spacious, and bright. At the back wall 
              and beneath a long skylight, an easel held a portrait in progress, 
              tilted at a 45 degree angle. Two tall windows yielded light from 
              the left wall, and a series of daguerreotypes adorned the right 
              wall. Works and supplies lined the floorboards. Nearer the front 
              was a long rectangular metal & formica type table with 6 metal chairs 
              seated around it. With a friendly greeting, Close offered me a seat 
              and then pulled up across from me at the table. He uses a wheelchair 
              ever since a collapsed spinal artery in 1988. The table was covered 
              with papers and telephones and the whole space had the good feel 
              of being very much worked in. Before we began, he took off a long 
              denim work apron from over his trousers and long sleeves. </font></p>
