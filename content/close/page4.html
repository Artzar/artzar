            <p><b><br>
              Did you ever consider yourself part of the photorealist movement?</b></p>
            <p> I never felt like I had much to do with the people who painted 
              tushies or trucks or something, but it wasn't that I just hated 
              all that stuff. No artist ever likes to be pigeonholed. And what 
              happens is that when critics begin to identify something that they 
              see as a tendency, they tend to write about what people have in 
              common. And what they share may not be the most important aspects 
              of the work. In fact, it's what makes each artist's work different 
              from the others which is interesting. But also I had trouble with 
              the word realism itself, because I was always as interested in the 
              artificiality as I was in the reality. It's the tension between 
              the marks on a flat surface, and then the image built, that interested 
              me. And I was always a dyed-in-the-wool formalist anyway. I think 
              process sets you free, because you know you don't have good days 
              or bad days. You just show up. You don't wait for inspiration. </p>
            <p><b>You've said that it's the same ethic associated with traditional 
              &quot;women's work.&quot; </b></p>
            <p>Yeah, I love what used to be called women's work. There was a reason, 
              and again it has to do with my learning disabilities. I didn't want 
              to reinvent the wheel every day. I wanted a way to work so that 
              today I do what I did yesterday, and tomorrow I'll do what I did 
              today...and while I sign on to this process for a while I will eventually 
              make something. And you know when women make quilts or something 
              like that, it was something they could pick up or put down, and 
              go back to after they start dinner or weed the garden or whatever...feed 
              the baby. I like that. I liked knowing where I was going to be for 
              a while. And things that are made that way are different from things 
              that are made all over at once. It's an entirely different thought 
              process. It's much more akin to writing, actually, than it is to 
              anything else. I mean, if you think about a writer, you're going 
              to write a novel that takes several months, but there's never a 
              time you're doing anything more than shoving one word up against 
              the next. And clusters of those words make sentences and paragraphs 
              and a chapter. You just try to maintain the same voice and the same 
              attitude so it sounds like the same person wrote the last chapter 
              that wrote the first chapter. And you keep the whole in your mind 
              but you can't worry about the whole. You have to engage yourself 
              on this very particular level of just fashioning something big out 
              of a lot of little pieces. </p>
            <p><b>I know your father worked in sheet metal and was always building 
              models, and even your bicycles, from scratch. </b></p>
            <p> He was so competent that while he was alive I didn't try to make 
              anything. I just watched him make stuff. But when he died I inherited 
              his tools, and I think had he lived I probably wouldn't necessarily 
              have ended up as handy as I became, you know. But my parents were 
              both very supportive of the idea of my being an artist. I had trouble 
              in school and I think they wanted me to feel good about myself and 
              feel special, so when I exhibited interest in magic, they would 
              help me do magic shows, and puppets, and also they got me private 
              art instruction when I was about 8. </p>
            <p><b>Now tell me how it came about that you took figure drawing lessons 
              at a local house of ill repute?</b></p>
            <p>I'm <i>assuming</i> that's what it was [<i>laughter</i>]. It was 
              only later that I figured out what must have been going on, because 
              there were a lot of women in the house who would pose for me and 
              there were a lot of men knocking on the door. </p>
            <p><b>Not other art students. </b></p>
            <p>No...being able to draw from the model did separate me from the 
              rest of the kids. </p>
            <p><b>And you also did artwork for your classes in school, for extra 
              credit?</b></p>
            <p> Yeah, since I couldn't demonstrate that I cared about the class 
              material by giving them names and dates and all that stuff, I was 
              always looking for some other way of telling them that I cared and 
              that I was serious. I remember doing this huge mural of the Lewis 
              and Clark Trail for extra credit, or when we were doing poetry or 
              something I would make some beautifully illustrated poetry book 
              or something, and that sort of hauled my ass out of the fire. I 
              never found any way to do anything in math though. </p>
            <p><b>I was thinking, what did he draw for math? Maybe grids? </b></p>
            <p>People look at the paintings and they assume that I must be, you 
              know... </p>
            <p><b>Kind of mathematically inclined? </b></p>
            <p> And I am <i>so</i> not. Here's the thing: Most people are good 
              at too many things. And when you say someone is focused, more often 
              than not what you actually mean is they're very narrow. And yet 
              if you put all your eggs in one basket and that's all you've got 
              to fall back on, pretty soon you distinguish yourself from the pack 
              by being more committed, more engaged, and caring more about it. 
              Because I wasn't athletic, I couldn't catch a ball, I couldn't throw 
              a ball, I had all kinds of physical limitations as well. So this 
              was it. </p>
            <p><b>What's the best thing and the most aggravating thing anyone 
              has ever said about your work?</b></p>
            <p> Well, when I was walking around I was 6 foot 3, and people didn't 
              tend to approach me very much, and one of the interesting things 
              about being in a wheelchair is it sort of cuts you down to size 
              and perhaps out of sympathy or whatever people feel much more like 
              coming up to you. I'm more accessible I guess down here. And then 
              people are also pulling for you. They like the idea you are able 
              to continue working or whatever. So it's been very gratifying to 
              have people tell me that my work has meaning for them. And you don't 
              really always know that, because you have this sort of ritual dance 
              you do in the studio and the painting is a sort of frozen record, 
              the evidence that the ritual took place. And then it goes out into 
              the world and you don't really know whether or not someone else 
              is dancing along with your piece, so it's nice to have them come 
              back and tell you that it was important for them. There are people, 
              some critics, art historians who have given me a way to think about 
              my own work and certainly have changed the way I think about the 
              work myself. And then of course there are all the negative reviews, 
              which also are incredibly important. I was going to use, as an example 
              of what's the best thing that was ever said to me, the most vicious 
              thing that was ever said to me, because it was a vicious thing said 
              by the right person. Hilton Kramer hated the work, and if he had 
              loved it I would have wanted to commit suicide, so. [<i>laughte</i>r] 
              And I still remember to this day that he called me a lunatic and 
              he said the work is the kind of trash that washed ashore when the 
              tide of pop art went out...he took a whole page of the Times railing 
              against me. And I thought, Gee, if he doesn't like what I'm doing, 
              then I must be on the right track. </p>
