            <p><b><br>
              When Joe Zucker showed up for a photo shoot in 1969, he was groomed, 
              as he put it, like a midwestern used car salesman, with slicked 
              hair, jacket and tie. Did you think, "Man, I wanted a picture of 
              you, why did you dress up like that"? </b> </p>
            <p> I thought it was interesting, because he was sort of wresting 
              control away from me. And he realized that he didn't need to get 
              involved with the image if it didn't look like him. He just needed 
              to produce evidence that someone like that existed. But it didn't 
              have to be him. And I thought that was so typically Joe, you know...it 
              made it even more about him. </p>
            <p><b>How do you choose what photos you'll work from? </b></p>
            <p> <a href="/content/close/graphics/glass_lg.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="/content/close/graphics/glass.jpg" width="140" height="180" align="right" border="0"></a>I'm 
              plagued with indecision in my life. I can't figure out what to order 
              in a restaurant. But it's usually not a problem. One of them floats 
              to the surface. And sometimes I really want to paint somebody and 
              I don't get a photograph that I want to work from and somebody that 
              I was far less interested in painting...their photograph just cries 
              out to be made into one. Certain images are just more interesting, 
              more compelling than others, and some of those are the ones that 
              I've recycled the most. Sometimes it's formal issues, like Philip 
              Glass with his curly dendritic locks that look like Medusa or something. 
              Those can become translated into fingerprints or dots or whatever, 
              in interesting ways. It's sort of more interesting than a smooth 
              outside shape. And then sometimes it's more psychological...I just 
              like the pose...or that there's something about their humanity or 
              something that comes through. </p>
            <p><b>That's a very nice photo of Robert Rauschenberg out there in 
              the entry way. He looks very much at ease. </b></p>
            <p>Yeah...actually I just did a big painting of him which is out being 
              varnished. </p>
            <p><b>After the photo, what's next?</b></p>
            <p>I take the photograph and I have a lot of sheets of acetate with 
              various size grids on them - diagonal, horizontal/vertical - and 
              I slide them around on top of the photograph and see how the rhythmic 
              beat of the squares fall on the image, and that usually determines 
              whether I want to do horizontal/vertical or diagonal. The number 
              of squares that it breaks down into will determine whether it's 
              a 9 foot painting, a 7 foot painting. </p>
            <p><b>In Keith/Six Drawings, what did "random" mean in the title, 
              Random Fingerprint Version? </b></p>
            <p> It means they were not organized in a grid. All the fingerprint 
              paintings are done without a grid. </p>
            <p><b>You've lived in New York for 4 decades. How has the city changed?</b></p>
            <p> It's a lot more expensive. The city continues to be a magnet for 
              the best and the brightest that come here from all over the country 
              and all over the world. It's a very vital exciting community. The 
              artworld gobbles up people and spits them out the other end and 
              keeps chugging along. It's a very dynamic process, hard on the individual 
              artists but good for the artworld. I think in Europe there's a very 
              different attitude towards art--you're sort of given your whole 
              life to make your work, whereas here it's, what have you done lately. 
              There are certainly downsides to that, but I insulate myself from 
              it by following the kind of logical progress of the work, and so 
              if fashions change or attitudes change it doesn't seem to have much 
              effect. But it does make for a very dynamic artworld. And Europe 
              often seems sort of overly concerned with the weight of history 
              and stuff. We don't have much history here, so...[<i>laughter</i>] 
            </p>
            <p><b>So the pressure for something new creates a dynamism, but does 
              it also bulldoze over some art? </b></p>
            <p>Oh yeah, sure...certainly when tastes change and fashion changes. 
              There's a kind of prevailing sensibility in any given moment in 
              time, so sometimes the artworld gravitates away from your issues 
              and then sometimes it will come back towards them. And you can either 
              choose to try and follow them, which isn't a very good idea, or 
              you can just sort of keep doing what you're doing and hope that 
              what you do and what the artworld wants intersect again. </p>
