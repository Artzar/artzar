                    do think that surprisingly there is a lot of wisdom in very 
                    short jokes. I don't know why this is. Its almost like... 
                    a small poem. But for some reason when I look at jokes - not 
                    mine, but just jokes in general - I'm amazed how they capture 
                    a philosophical idea so succinctly.&quot; </font></p></td>

                    a terrible player. All the acceptance I get is because I make 
                    movies. If I didn't make movies, no one would hire me to play 
                    music. I couldn't make a living at it. So when people come, 
                    they come more because they enjoyed my movies than to hear 
                    me play. Now what I do have is great affectionate enthusiasm 
                    for the music, and so I play with a lot of passion, but it 
                    doesn't matter because I don't have the talent. So the jazz 
                    people in the jazz world to my face are very kind, but behind 
                    my back they must roll their eyes and think...you know...that 
                    many more deserving musicians don't do as well, while I get 
                    a good size audience.&quot;</font></p></td>
