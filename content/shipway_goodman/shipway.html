            <P><FONT color="#FFFFFF">Alan Shipway's paintings are on display in 
              the white cube space of this small gallery. Born in 1958, a graduate 
              of the Edinburgh University Architecture Department and St Martins, 
              London, his works are an interesting amalgamation of various artists' 
              influences. He is described by the gallery curator as having a deep 
              knowledge and understanding of the history of art and reverence 
              for thirteenth century Italian painting, seen in examples of his 
              work such as the oil on canvas, Homage to Fra Angelico. Rothko-like 
              is its divisions of light and dark blue-greys, the soft hues would 
              be well placed alongside the gentle blue-greys Angelico used.<BR>
              <BR>
              Perhaps the most original aspect of Shipway's work is the rather 
              obstructive but somehow endearing placement of a barcode color palette 
              on most of the canvases. Existing in their own designated place 
              on the surface, in a corner, or in the very centre, they retain 
              the dark cream of cardboard colour, painted around with whichever 
              colors are in use for the rest of the canvas surface and isolated 
              by this designation. The barcode palette, crudely done in black 
              paint over pencil, consists of the written color word on the left, 
              alongside which is dabbed a brushstroke of the color. At first jarring 
              on the eye, it becomes a representation of the artist at work, researching 
              and pushing himself in the search for just the right colour and 
              expression from the limitations of the palette he has set himself. 
              It is not clear whether Shipway limited himself to the colours on 
              his barcode palette only, for most pieces are light with the use 
              of creams and off-whites which are not featured options on his palette.

            <P><FONT color="#FFFFFF">The hanging of five canvases close beside 
              one another caused the individual relevance of the works to be lost 
              in a 'noise' of contrasting tones of darks and lights, colours of 
              reds and greens and subject matter ranging from Spring Green Tree, 
              Leaves on Dark Water, Book (Duccio) to the before-mentioned Homage 
              to Fra Angelico. On the other hand, more complimentarily is the 
              placement of a creamy white large canvas, its surface divided with 
              a wide red-squared backward P, on a wall of its own. Entitled Apostle 
              and adorned with the barcode palette, the work gave the impression 
              of a study for something still to come but content upon the wall 
              to bide its time, held up by the wide brushstroked red. His technique 
              seems hurried and unfinished and the canvases maintain the look 
              of the unfinished, undernourished of time and completion. Shipways 
              works are reminiscent of the works of Modigliani (in the work Path 
              where again red paint attaches itself to the creamy white below 
              in an emulation almost of one of Modigliani, or Brancusi's, noses), 
              Morris Lewis, Rothko and Anthony Caro. </FONT></P>
            <P><FONT color="#FFFFFF">With both smaller and larger pieces on display, 
              the works on paper seem to be preparatory studies for the larger 
              canvases and the repetition of the similar, or the same, images 
              lead to a limited display of his oeuvre. I found the catalogue gave 
              a better depiction of his works for the smaller colour reproductions 
              gave the canvases a colour clarity and strength and the required, 
              at times, gentleness which the canvases seemed to lack in the draining 
              white cube space.<BR>
