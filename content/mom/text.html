              my mother advised me as she lay in St. Vincents Hospital in July 
              1993. I had just returned from my weekend &#8220;share house&#8221; 
              in Westhampton, where I was told I had better strengthen my serve 
              if I wanted to go anywhere in tennis. I was 39.</p>
            <p>When Mom and I were alone she would talk about tennis. She revered 
              the game and serious players. In the women's final at Wimbledon 
              that July, Jana Novotna had led Steffi Graff, who was considered 
              unbeatable, by a set, when Novotna's game fell apart. She went on 
              to lose the match, and when formally introduced to the Duchess of 
              Windsor afterward, collapsed into the duchess&#8217;s arms rather 
              than curtsying as is usual with members of the royal family. &#8220;Tennis 
              can be so cruel,&#8221; Mom cried. &#8220;You can be playing beautifully 
              and it can just slip away from you in a snap.&#8221; </p></td>

              War I, and then married and started a practice and family. Like 
              my parents would do later, he and Florence settled in to a life 
              of stultifying routine. Strangling his family with strictness and

              Mom and Dad got engaged. Married. Within a couple of years, rock 
              n' roll had replaced swing, and Dad left the music business. Mom 
              discovered he wasn&#8217;t a cool, freewheeling jazz musician at 
              all, but a narrow-minded working man with traditional values and 
              an iron bond to his mother. Divorce was unusual in the early fifties. 
              A divorcee in her mid-twenties was stained goods. Even if the times 
              had been permissive of divorce, my mother wouldn&#8217;t have sought 
              one. She hadn&#8217;t the strength to admit the mistake, go through 
              with the ugly proceedings, face up, and return to her parents' house.

            was too strong a claim, she thought, so she described herself as a 
            strong intermediate. We went out for a bite afterward and Mom had 
            her usual rare hamburger, an unhealthy choice that irked me. I&#8217;d 
            always admired Mom's athletic figure, but at 66, she was getting heavy 
            around the waist. We returned downtown on the subway and when I got 
            off at the stop before hers I was struck by a glassy, faraway expression 
            after she coughed. An eerie feeling overtook me but I dismissed it.</td>

          <td><p>In the last days before the biopsy, a former boss of Mom's came 
              to visit. She adored him because he had given her a job she loved, 
              and a sense of belonging. He organized business conferences which 
              he would cancel, then keep monies he&#8217;d received. She was too 
              weak to groom herself, even to sit up. And he felt awkward, having 
              brought a gift for her birthday. At a loss for words, he said, &#8220;Barbara, 
              you&#8217;ll get this biopsy done, and then you&#8217;ll be just&#8230;&#8221; 
              Mom interrupted him. &#8220;Dead. I&#8217;ll be dead,&#8221; she 
              stated.</p>
            <p>The next day was the day before the biopsy, so numerous blood tests 
              were taken prior to surgery. As Mom lay on her side we could see 
              a part of her back swell as she struggled to breathe. There was 
              little healthy lung left and a small piece was doing all the work. 
              The biopsy was scheduled for 11:30 the next morning. When Dr. Halperin 
              came in to see Mom, he said it looked like she was having a good 
              day. He said, &quot;This always happens. You schedule a procedure 
              and the patient turns out not to need it.&quot; But he told my father 
              privately that if they could get her through this, it would be an 
              accomplishment.</p></td>

          <td><p>The elevator opened into an open area and Mom&#8217;s handlers 
              pushed her through wide swinging doors. A team of pathologists, 
              anesthesiologists, surgeons, and nurses surrounded her gurney. Towering 
              over Mom, they discussed what kind of specimen was needed from what 
              part of which lung. I tried to listen to what they were saying but 
              could hear nothing amid the din. Mom tugged at my shirt. I leaned 
              over, and she whispered, &#8220;the stateroom scene.&#8221; &#8220;Yes,&#8221; 
              I said. &#8220;A Night at the Opera!&#8221; Mom nodded. She was 
              reminding me of a scene from the Marx Brothers' &#8220;A Night at 
              the Opera&#8221; in which tens of individuals crowd into the tiny 
              stateroom of an ocean liner. Room service, manicurists, barbers, 
              and bellhops climb atop one another, each trying to perform a job 
              amid chaos. </p>
            <p>Then she was gone. My dad and I sat in the main lobby of the hospital 
              unwinding from the harrowing afternoon. We embraced, weeping. My 
              dad tried to comfort me as the sorrow I&#8217;d masked earlier poured 
              out. &#8220;If she doesn't make it, I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;ll 
              never laugh again. I won&#8217;t be able to go on living,&#8221; 
              I said. &#8220;But death is a part of life,&quot; Dad answered, 
              &#8220;and it makes it easier, because then the suffering will be 
              with us, she won&#8217;t be suffering anymore.&#8221;</p></td>

          <td><p>Mom was engulfed in a maze of wires and machines beeping randomly 
              at high and low tones. A plastic hose and mask had been placed in 
              her mouth and taped to her face. Her jaw was fixed wide open, gaping 
              and ghastly. Railings were up on both sides of the bed, preventing 
              us from getting close. She couldn&#8217;t move her mouth to speak, 
              and communicated with her eyes, which screamed, &#8220;Get me out 
              of here!&#8221; </p>
            <p>One day when I arrived at Mom&#8217;s bedside, Dr. Halperin clutched 
              my hand so tight he nearly broke it. He said Mom had turned a corner. 
              An x-ray showed the pneumonia was receding. The erythromycin had 
              been working. This meant that in all likelihood she had Legionnaire&#8217;s 
              disease. Mom was oblivious to the good news. After all, she still 
              had a large plastic tube taped to her face and was covered by IV 
              lines, catheters, and electrodes. Crying with glee, I told Mom she 
              was the bravest person I&#8217;d ever known, that she had done a 
              hundred triathlons.</p>
            <p>It was a victorious day when Mom was moved out of the ICU and into 
              the step-down unit, a regular hospital ward. One day the respirator 
              was unhooked and she breathed on her own for 45 minutes. The entire 
              staff of the floor applauded her.</p></td>

            <p>One afternoon my father phoned me and said he had received a call 
              from Dr. Carpati. Mom's lungs were failing, the respirator had to 
              be raised to 100% oxygen. A second, emergency biopsy was underway.</p>
            <p>Mom was now in the largest room of the ICU, the one reserved for 
              patients who need more monitors than the others. The bed faces outward 
              toward the hall and a wall of glass enables constant observation. 
              This is where moribund patients are placed.</p>
            <p>I knew this was probably the last evening I could spend with Mom 
              and determined to stay the night in the waiting room. Though Mom 
              was sedated, maybe she&#8217;d sense my presence, know that I was 
              there. My father wanted to leave. Dr. Carpati pulled me aside, recommended 
              my dad and I stay together. I was young and could spend the night 
              in a hospital waiting room, but my father, 70 years old, couldn&#8217;t 
              do that. I went to my Dad&#8217;s, slept on the sofa in the living 
              room. I kept the phone beside me in case the hospital called.</p></td>

          <td><p>It was 6.30 a.m. I dressed and walked to the hospital. Dr. Carpati 
              greeted me with bad news. Mom had not responded to the medications. 
              She could live another few days, perhaps a week or more.</p>
            <p>Mom&#8217;s body was swelled to the point where she no longer looked 
              female. She was like a figure in a Fernando Botero painting, inflated 
              like a sausage. Mom would have deplored this situation. I wanted 
              to put an end to this lingering state before she heard any of the 
              staff mention her dying.</p>
            <p>I saw a nun and told her we needed a prayer read by a rabbi before 
              withdrawing life support. She said that it being the Jewish New 
              Year, the rabbi was off. But she would find the priest. I asked 
              that he bring the 23rd Psalm. He came running up about 10 minutes 
              later with a photocopy. Said he didn&#8217;t have much occasion 
              to use the 23rd Psalm, it being from the Old Testament. He was so 
              anxious when photocopying it, that he cut off half the prayer. The 
              three of us huddled in the waiting room as he read the prayer aloud. 
              Dad signed the withdrawal consent. </p></td>

              death, my father drew a blank when the rabbi, who hadn't known her, 
              asked him about her. They hadn&#8217;t really spoken in 20 years. 
              Dad said she was a very discerning woman, had good taste. I asked 
              the rabbi about the tradition of placing a rock at a person&#8217;s 
              grave. What did it mean? He said that in the old days, people used 
              to make a day of it when they&#8217;d come to visit loved ones. 
              They&#8217;d have a picnic lunch in the cemetery. When it came time 
              to leave, they&#8217;d denote their presence by leaving a rock. 
              It was a way to let people know the deceased had been visited. So 
              I collected a dozen rocks and placed them on Mom&#8217;s stone.
