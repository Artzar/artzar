	  <p><font size="+2">H</font>e had died. Too soon; much to soon. He wasn't 
        supposed to have gone, certainly not just yet. And it was permanent. Permanent! 
        In ten years, perhaps then. Still she couldn't believe it;<i> must be 
        a bad dream, mustn't it?</i> That's what she thought, or wished was actually 
        so, not wanting to deal with this reality.</p>
      <p> The man was to have been her father-in-law. Indeed, could have, should 
        have, would have. If only he'd waited. But then it wasn't his intention 
        to go. He didn't want such a heinous act to occur, and it was entirely 
        out of his control: an accident? Not really. Nor was it intentional, but 
        then how does one excuse an error? Is that what they call it? Turn your 
        back for a second, listen to their instructions, 'go home, he'll be okay; 
        come back in the morning, and he'll be ready. You can take him home tomorrow. 
        Now get some sleep. Don't worry, he's in the best of care, the best of 
        hands.' <i>Yes, but, shouldn't I stay?</i> she only thought, as she walked 
        out of the sterile room.</p>
      <p>And the next morning does come, as promised, and all prepared to bring 
        him home, an announcement is made, spitting bludgeoning words at her face, 
        screaming out that, 'He didn't make it. We're very sorry.'</p>
      <p> But she didn't want sorry, nor need it, 'Bring him back. You said, you 
        said...and I did what you said. You lied. You're not God, like I mistook 
        you for.'</p>
      <p>Her wedding was to have taken place sometime in the future. No particular 
        date had been set. Only that it was to be. And he, her future father-in-law 
        was to wear a white dinner jacket. And he had been promised the first 
        dance with his new daughter-in-law, following her first dance with her 
        groom. Without forethought of music, to dance the first dance as a legal 
        member...finally. She was so proud, an honor bestowed; a father-in-law 
        to lean upon, to walk with through a wooded terrain, shielding her from 
        the devil-coated blinding sun, and learn all about Canadian Geese, and 
        Big Berthas, and Tucson real estate, and riches from the heart. And in 
        the midst of it all, stealthily stuffing a pipe, and sharing an unspoken 
        smoke.</p>
      <p>Now sitting beneath a huge pine tree, the biggest one at the cemetery, 
        she pondered her would-have-been new father-in-law. Quietly listening, 
        cradled in a garden of headstones, decorated with sporadic yellow daffodils, 
        white roses, and rocks of plenty; her new husband was meandering about 
        in his own private confusion, only to join her in silence, which was abruptly 
        interrupted by her own laughter.</p>
      <p>"What's so funny?" he asked.</p>
      <p>"Oh my," she said aghast. "He, he tried to sit up." </p>
      <p>"What? Who?" said her new husband. </p>
      <p>"Your dad. I saw him. And he tried to sit up, in his coffin, and he hit 
        his head on the top." </p>
      <p>"On the top of what?" her new husband demanded. </p>
      <p>"On the <i>top</i> of the coffin. The lid's still on," she said, badgered 
        by his ignorance, "and he bumped his head." </p>
      <p>"Oh." he said, with a shady glance. </p>
      <p>"I saw him, and I heard him too. I mean this. Truly I do." </p>
      <p>"I don't hear anything," her new husband said as if he were a jackass 
        sitting in a bucket of shit. "What did he say?"</p>
      <p>"He's hungry." <br>
        <br>
        The new husband only wished he too could hear his father, let alone see 
        him. It had been four months since the burial, and this was the first 
        time they had visited the grave site. Hoping that time would blindly seal 
        away some of the memory, and blend itself into their lives, like a mixture 
        of white flour, salt, and baking soda.</p>
      <p> They were to have been married along the small boat pond in Central 
        Park; veiled in white lace, it had been planned that she would arrive 
        in a gondola, white gardenias strewn about, where the promised father-in-law 
        to be was to have met her, guiding her onto the landing, and arm in arm, 
        escorting her down the aisle: a short, narrow path covered with rustic 
        autumn leaves, roped off on either side in heavy gold; off to meet the 
        promised groom. Not too much froth, or silvery buttons, or glistening 
        lights, but rather candles glowing and dancing in the waters mirroring 
        a titillating agitation.</p>
      <p> A white dinner jacket, a tiny ballet pink rose, encased inside of a 
        hefty pride embossed frame: the picture, notched deep into her memory 
        bank. But soon transforming her dismal muse to that of an obese Fairy 
        Godmother clutching a magical wand containing the power to strike out 
        her noir memory<i>....shall we dance a waltz? Show me your hand. Yes, 
        you are my daughter-in-law now.</i></p>
      <p>The new husband so much coveted for her cunningness, "Teach me how to 
        do it," he pleaded. "What's he saying now? How does he look?" </p>
      <p>"Crowded. Cute." </p>
      <p>"Cute?" </p>
      <p>"Cute," she repeated. "He was telling me about the deli we passed on 
        the way here, and sardonically added that we should have brought some 
        lox and bagels and cream cheese. All he talks about is food." Her eyes 
        were closed, and her lips regaled a continuous smile. </p>
      <p>"How does he sound?" the new husband asked. </p>
      <p>"Strong. Content. Peaceful. He's not bothered by the fact that he's <i>there</i>, 
        other than he's so damn hungry." A pervasive serenity hovered for a moment, 
        then she continued, "Relax, and close your eyes. Take some deep breaths, 
        and..." </p>
      <p>"Oh, oh, he spoke to me." </p>
      <p>"No kidding. What'd he say?" she asked. </p>
      <p>"He said, 'Pastrami on rye'. And 'Don't forget the extra mustard.' And 
        he wants to know 'What took you guys so long to come here'?" </p>
      <p>"He's sitting beside you now. But you already knew that. And his left 
        arm is resting along your back and left shoulder," she told the new husband. 
      </p>
      <p>Then the new husband suddenly stood up, and reached out his hand for 
        her, his new wife, to join him. At that point he placed his right arm 
        around her waist, took her right hand into his left hand, holding her 
        very close. Situated in their small circle under the enormous pine tree, 
        they danced, without song, they danced. And the new husband said to her, 
        his new wife, "He asked me to have this dance with you just for him. A 
        waltz. We shall waltz then, my wife."</p>
