            <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Regardless 
              of your take (and there are many), Timothy Leary will be remembered 
              as one of the 20th century's mightiest figures. Psychologist, psychedelic 
              rabble-rouser, zen prankster, international criminal, cyber-guru, 
              visionary... the list could go on. Leary said it best: : "You get 
              the Timothy Leary that you deserve."</font></p>
            <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The author 
              of such books as <i>The Interpersonal Diagnosis of Personality</i> 
              (1957), <i>The Psychedelic Experience</i> (1964), <i>High Priest</i> 
              (1968), <i>Exo-Psychology</i> (1977), <i>Flashbacks</i> (1983), 
              <i>Surfing the Conscious Nets</i> (1995), among others, Timothy 
              Leary will continue to amaze and confound us for generations to 
              come. His legacy is well represented by his web site, which he worked 
              on intensely before his death.</font></p>
            <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I spoke with 
              Timothy Leary by phone at his home in Beverly Hills in the fall 
              of 1995. At the time, the hoopla surrounding his imminent "de-animation" 
              was in full swing. He was in the upbeat process of what he called 
              "designer dying." Leary was again smashing cultural taboos. He brought 
              to the world a new and absolutely positive approach to the meeting 
              with the unknown. I'd just read <i>Chaos and Cyber Culture</i> (Ronin 
              Publishing, 1995) and come away with a new appreciation not only 
              of the creative possibilities of the computer but of the sweet Chaos 
              which we call the world. </font></p>

              What higher power brought the computer into being?</b></font></p>
            <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Leary: The 
              brain. The brain wants light. The brain is drinking our bodies around 
              to bring her light. We have the equipment waiting there. It's time 
              to wake up and use it.</font></p>
            <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>You've said 
              that over time this will eliminate the barriers of language that 
              have been responsible for most war and conflict. Is this the way 
              to a kind of global, empathetic consciousness?</b></font></p>
            <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Absolutely. 
              Most of the quarrels in human history are based on different language 
              groups. Kids growing up in the 90s are going to be exposed to global 
              information by the time they're crawling or toddling.</font></p>
            <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b> It's all 
              moving at light-speed, isn't it.</b></font></p>
            <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That's been 
              an aspiration, a hope of visionaries all the time. They want to 
              be able to move like light. The metaphors, poetically, have been 
              there. We're a young, a very, very young adolescent species and 
              we're now just catching up to the fact that your body is your brain. 
              That's important. The body is just the vehicle for your brain. Technologically, 
              we can use that language of the brain, which are light clusters 
              on your screen.</font></p>
            <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b> In <i>Chaos 
              and Cyber-Culture</i> you talk about the 1967 Human Be-In where 
              you challenged a crowd of 30,000 people in Golden Gate Park to "Turn 
              on, tune in, drop out." You call it the dawning of the psychedelic-cyber-netic 
              age. For nearly 10 years now Michael Gosney has been holding a Digital 
              Be-In annually in San Francisco in which you've participated. What's 
              happening with this kind of leap?</b></font></p>
            <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Gosney's taking 
              that wonderful concept of the Be-In and some of the spirit of that 
              time and bringing it to the next level of reality, which is electronic 
              virtual reality and multimedia. Same message passed on in a better 
              form now because when you get into electronic light media, you're 
              working with light as a basic language. That's good. Michael's one 
              of the few great pioneer humanists in the digital world.</font></p>
            <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>And our 
              neurons need this stimulation?</b></font></p>
            <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That's what 
              my brain tells me. It's starved. It wants more electricity. More 
              light. More change. She can handle a hundred and twenty-five million 
              signals a second and I'm going along with like one...two...three...four. 
              [laughs] Big deal. Up it.</font></p>

              the human race. The tide, the surf is there. I've been surfing it. 
              Calling your attention. Hey, look over there. The big wave's catchin' 
              up. Get ready for it.</font></p>
