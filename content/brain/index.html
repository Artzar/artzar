      <P align="right"><FONT color="66CCFF" size="+1"><TT>Man has a limitation 
        on his nervous system which makes it impossible for him <BR>
        to engage the world in a fruitful fashion; <FONT color="#FFFFFF">he is 
        unable to predict events and circumstances with enough reliability to 
        secure his well-being.</FONT><BR>
        For instance, man is unable to guarantee himself a steady supply<BR>
        of food. Hunger is still a fundamental problem despite the trappings of 
        civilization and all our technological<BR>
        brilliance.</TT></FONT></P>
      <P align="right"><FONT size="+1"><TT><FONT color="66CCFF"> The apparent 
        success of some at the enterprise of living, is merely an illusion. <FONT color="#FFFFFF">It 
        is at great cost to the<BR>
        ecosystem and other societies that some societies are able to secure a 
        steady stream of resources</FONT> for their inhabitants.</FONT></TT></FONT></P>
      <P align="right"><FONT size="+1"><TT><FONT color="66CCFF"> We engage in 
        philosophical theorizing in an attempt to come to grips with our problems 
        but it is not<BR>
        enough. Man needs a way to deal with the particulars of the everyday. 
        It is on the level of the particulars of the everyday that man secures 
        from the world the necessities of living.</FONT></TT></FONT></P>
      <P align="right"><FONT size="+1"><TT><FONT color="66CCFF"> What is it then 
        that is missing? What is the cause of so much unhappiness and physical 
        suffering? I can specify precisely what it is. <FONT color="#FFFFFF">It 
        is an inability of the brain to utilize<BR>
        more than a small amount of information from the outside world in the 
        making of decisions.</FONT> When we are unable to<BR>
        incorporate more than just a small amount of information into our<BR>
        decision-making we misjudge reality and so act in ways which are foolish, 
        wasteful, and physically harmful. This<BR>
        represents a fundamental defect of the brain; it is not amenable to education 
        or training.</FONT></TT></FONT></P>
      <P align="right"><FONT size="+1"><TT><FONT color="66CCFF"> Many of us live 
        in successful societies and are protected by those societies from the 
        harshness of reality. We are not battered <BR>
        on a daily basis by the uncertainty of securing food, water, and shelter. 
        Even within so-called successful societies, however, there are many who 
        struggle to survive. For <BR>
        instance, <BR>
        <FONT color="#FFFFFF">homelessness and poverty still persist in the land 
        of plenty</FONT> known as the United States of America. The struggles 
        of life are even more evident in the world as a whole. Across wide swaths 
        of the globe, hundreds of millions go hungry, basic hygiene is a rarity, 
        and disease and violence are constant realities.</FONT></TT></FONT></P>
      <P align="right"><FONT size="+1"><TT><FONT color="66CCFF"> Existence for 
        many is a struggle, but <FONT color="#FFFFFF">why is it a struggle?</FONT> 
        Has anyone answered this question to our satisfaction in 3500 years of 
        recorded history? Why haven't lifetimes worth of<BR>
        Inquiry by the best minds of every generation yielded an answer? Our world<BR>
        is filled with suffering and premature death but no answer seems forthcoming. 
        Could it be that our problem goes beyond mere intellectual endeavors?<BR>
        <BR>
        I claim that <FONT color="#FFFFFF">our problem is a physical problem with 
        our brain</FONT>. The physical operation of our brain is not<BR>
        compatible with happiness. What the brain does is to assure the reproductive 
        success of the species; it does not assure any individual a reasonably 
        comfortable life. A reasonably comfortable life is an artifact of society 
        and at any one point in time it is the purview of only select societies. 
        It is up to us to<BR>
        change the physical operation of the brain in order to make life worthwhile 
        for all.<BR>
        <BR>
        <FONT color="#FFFFFF">We now have technology in the form of the computer 
        to help us elucidate our brain problem.</FONT> In the apolitical,<BR>
        amoral light of the laboratory, it has been shown that the brain has trouble 
        classifying the simplest of <FONT color="#FFFFFF">patterns</FONT>. Why 
        is this important? Because in a complex world where no two situations 
        are exactly alike, the identification<BR>
        of familiar <FONT color="#FFFFFF">patterns</FONT> is the ultimate factor 
        determining our behavior. Any<BR>
        situation presents itself as a <FONT color="#FFFFFF">pattern</FONT> of 
        information which our brain must evaluate. It does this by comparing the 
        present <FONT color="#FFFFFF">pattern</FONT> with <FONT color="#FFFFFF">patterns</FONT> 
        gleaned<BR>
        from past experiences. The brain depends on matching the new <FONT color="#FFFFFF">pattern</FONT> 
        with <FONT color="#FFFFFF">patterns</FONT> stored in memory in order to 
        know what action to take. We act in pursuit of a bite to eat, a friendly 
        word, or a warm place to sleep at night. Success at securing our reward 
        depends on assessing new situations correctly. This can only take place 
        if the <FONT color="#FFFFFF">pattern</FONT> from our memory we have selected 
        as a match truly is a match. The <FONT color="#FFFFFF">pattern</FONT> 
        from memory must match the <FONT color="#FFFFFF">pattern</FONT> represented 
        by the new situation in order that our action be guaranteed appropriate. 
        </FONT></TT></FONT></P>
      <P align="right"><FONT size="+1"><TT><FONT color="66CCFF"> Since the problem, 
        as I see it, is an inadequacy with which the brain processes information 
        <FONT color="#FFFFFF">we need to augment the brain's ability to process 
        information</FONT>. The computer presents<BR>
        itself as an information processing device par excellence. In point of 
        fact, the computer is able to perform<BR>
        information processing in a way that precisely complements that of the 
        human<BR>
        nervous system. If we are to hope to increase our ability to process<BR>
        information and thereby improve our ability to interact with the world 
        <FONT color="#FFFFFF">we need to find a way to link a computer to the 
        brain</FONT>.</FONT></TT></FONT></P>
