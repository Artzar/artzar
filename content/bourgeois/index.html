            <p align="left"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At 
              92, Louise Bourgeois is still producing vibrant, large-scale work 
              that continues themes explored throughout her career. &quot;<b><font color="#000033">I 
              am a long distance runner and a lonely runner, and that's the way 
              I like it</font></b>,&quot; she said in an interview conducted by 
              e-mail in June 2002. The ongoing success of Bourgeois' sculptures 
              lies in their ability to transcend the personal subjectivity of 
              the maker into collective, objective human experience. And in her 
              fresh and fearless approach to materials. But it is the personal 
              origin of the work that fuels its deep emotional impact. </font></p>

            <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Bourgeois translates 
              memory and feeling into a universal visceral visual language by 
              using materials in a way that heightens both their expressive value 
              and that of the form they describe. She commits herself to no particular 
              material or&#151;like Gerhard Richter&#151;style of self-expression, 
              preferring instead to mine all possibilities for the most potent 
              combination. Working in everything from fabric to bronze, she calls 
              forth the medium's shamanistic quality and uses it to construct 
              elemental forms that balance gracefully between rawness and restraint. 
              Despite the specificity of many titles, the work is more literary 
              than literal, invoking a pantheon of mythologic and psychologic 
              symbolism. </font></p>

            recent solo show&#151;the first in New York since 1994&#151;at Cheim 
            &amp; Read featured large narrative sculptural works comprised of 
            multiple media. Figures of stitched fabric recall her earlier &quot;personnages.&quot; 
            But the newer pieces are soft, doll-like compared to the totemic wood 
            and bronze pieces from the 40s. New and old share Bourgeois' obsessive 
            processing of the past and, as in all of her work, this exorcism functions 
            as springboard to many other issues lodged in her consciousness: femininity, 
            self-image, sexuality, mortality. </font></td>

            <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Born in 1911 
              in Paris, Bourgeois was involved at an early age in her parent's 
              business. At fifteen she began working in their successful tapestry 
              restoration studio. However, at that point she was already painfully 
              party to the marital drama epitomized by her father's philandering 
              and her mother's passivity. She fled what she describes as this 
              &quot;nest of nuts&quot; to study math at the Sorbonne which, at 
              twenty-five, she gave up for art. In 1938, newly married to the 
              American art historian Robert Goldwater, Bourgeois arrived in New 
              York. Rather than taking up the common modern cause, the anarchic 
              path of her work became a way to affirm herself and her past through 
              differentiation from the status quo. </font> </p>

          <td height="300"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Having 
            worked for so many decades in solitude, Bourgeois' international recognition 
            over the last two decades, beginning with her first museum show at 
            MoMa in 1982, has done little to change her course. Her commitment 
            to the personal throughout the formal reduction of Modernism and Minimalism 
            made her a galvanizing force for the post modern subjectivist movement. 
            Yet hers was not a reaction to contemporary movements, but a force 
            that began with the Surrealists with whom she consorted in Montparnasse 
            in the 30s. </font></td>

          <td height="300"> 
            <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The vindication 
              of belated acclaim is surely sweet, but for Bourgeois it is incidental: 
              &quot;<font color="#003333"><b><font color="#000033">I don't need 
              success. It's not what motivates me. Though success is sexy.</font></b></font>&quot; 
              And success in the art world is not so easily opted out of if one 
              wants to continue producing work for public consumption. It is also 
              demanding, especially for someone so entrenched in her own life. 
              The recognition bears public responsibility&#151;if only to refute 
              inaccuracies of interpretation&#151;and Bourgeois vacillates between 
              candor and the caginess of obligation. It seems that the confessional 
              approach she takes to certain parts of her past is a tithe she pays 
              for the protection of other domains. Though a mother herself, she 
              speaks very little of her own family, as if to shield them from 
              prying eyes. Or perhaps, her work is purely autobiographical and 
              it does encompass her children to the extent that they are a part 
              of her. In some ways they are her most successful sculptures of 
              all. </font></p>

          <td height="300"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Bourgeois' 
            new works are haunting. They range from the aggressive emotion fully 
            figurated in <i>Rejection</i>, <i>Hysterical</i>, and<i> We Love You</i> 
            to the more familiar psychosexual symbolism of abstracted works like 
            <i>Cell XIII</i> and <i>Untitled</i>. These vivid three-dimensional 
            tableaux created from fabric sculpture share the complex and explicit 
            narrative of traditional tapestry. Other untitled pieces resemble 
            stacks of children's building blocks constructed from fragments of 
            actual tapestry. But the artist is resistant to neat assumptions about 
            her work coming full circle with her past. &quot;<font color="#000033"><b>The 
            idea of restoration is deep within me.</b></font>&quot; However, she 
            is quick to refuse textiles any privilege, despite her beginnings 
            in tapestry: &quot;<b><font color="#000033">I am not interested in 
            any one material. The materials are just materials, and they are there 
            to serve me.</font></b>&quot; And some serve certain ideas better 
            than others. Cheim &amp; Read describe a shift in message via materials: 
            <i>&quot;The images of severing and fragmentation in the earlier periods 
            of Bourgeois' work associated with the father is replaced in these 
            works by the activity of binding and holding together, associated 
            with the mother. Stitching becomes a form of healing. Fragments become 
            ordered and unified, edges become softer. The integration of the parts 
            represents a desire for restoration, reparation and reconciliation.&quot;</i></font></td>

            <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Despite her 
              age, the physical aspect of creating art remains at the core of 
              Bourgeois' ability to reconcile past with present: &quot;The role 
              of my own body is crucial. There is anxiety at the beginning of 
              the process, and hopefully in the end the tension in the body is 
              released.&quot; Creation conflates emotion and action, offering 
              new energy and perspective: &quot;Art should help you to be able 
              to deal with other people. It should give you insights into yourself.&quot; 
              But it is an ongoing struggle, one in which the artist's stamina 
              and tenacity is recorded by decades of powerful visual testament. 
              &quot;<b><font color="#000033">I want to be at peace with myself 
              and others. And that's hard.</font></b>&quot; Assuring-happily for 
              the viewing public-that her process, like Penelope's, will continue 
              indefinitely. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
