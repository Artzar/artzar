                  <p align="left"><font size="-1"><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Evening,
                    last one in, Cubby sat inside a vintage Volkswagen cab while
                    the driver, palming directions in his steering-wheel hand
                    (a well-worn address, many times folded and unfolded), wended
                    through narrow, rutted side streets and unpaved alleys, as
                    deep into the inferno as one could get. In the rear, Cubby
                    was bug-eyed; his face, puffed and distorted with drink and
                    misdirected energy, was contorting into deformities, even
                    worse than those of the passersby. The taxista discharged
                    him before a block of battered storefronts. At one time, when
                    the tumbledown street had been busy, the fronts had been painted
                    like a fun-house, sharp pink against yellow. Now it was solid
                    gang graffiti. Cubby knew where he was, and found a staircase
                    leading up, hit a landing, passed through a metal gate with
                    an unlatched asylum lock.</font></b></font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font size="-1"><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Beyond
                    was a small apartment and a studio; every inch of wall was
                    hung with flash; a weird array of sketches and photographs
                    and wooden grape-crate slats decorated with abstract black
                    tribal shapes, stark Catholic images; the Holy Infant and
                    Our Lady of Perpetual Mercy and various miracle-working saints.
                    The room reeked of hydrochloric acid, but it wasn't coming
                    from the tattoo equipment, it was coming from the proprietor's
                    skin; his sweat smelled like a car battery. He was perched
                    on a grungy, mealy sofa in a vague lotus position. His feet,
                    wrapped in heavy woolen socks, jutted over the edge; he was
                    almost six and a half feet tall, and didn't fit the couch.
                    Still, he had a settled look. A Parcheesi board sat on the
                    floor beneath him, next to a grocery bag filled with reefer
                    and some gems of local cuisine, three days old, half-eaten
                    in a plate.</font></b></font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font size="-1"><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Cubby
                    stood in the doorway, supporting himself, dumping perspiration.
                    Swollen capillaries gave his eyes a severe, lusterless look;
                    he focused them on the lotus man's chest. A scapular with
                    a plastic cross hung there, and below that, on the skin, was
                    a single, huge picture; a beautiful young Hindi boy, with
                    his foot on the head of another beautiful young Hindi boy,
                    who was dead.</font></b></font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font size="-1"><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The
                    lotus man considered Cubby through fluttering eyelids. His
                    name was Darius, but he went by 'Ant'. A joke, of course,
                    referring to his size. Cubby could appreciate jokes like that.
                    Ant looked like a marble carving; an intense pallor delved
                    into the hollows of his cheeks, his lips were almost white.
                    He was a junkie, and a certain lucidity arises in the skin
                    of junkies, growing more intense in the weeks before they
                    die. They begin to resemble sculptured shells, since the corrosion
                    is moving from the inside out, like a corpse decomposing within
                    a vacuum chamber. At the final stage, they fairly glow. Prevailing
                    wisdom suggests that, since they are so close to death, the
                    light is supernatural.</font></b></font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font size="-1"><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It
                    was dusk, but a rooster was screaming somewhere. Ant unwound
                    his limbs, pushed himself up, using a crutch cut from an acote
                    branch. Acote was supposed to be spiritual wood, channeling
                    potent energies. Barring intervention from one of the flash
                    saints on the wall, he needed all the help he could get. He
                    was from Oakland and was still a bit California cosmic; he'd
                    come to Mexico chiefly for the dope. Cubby hovered in his
                    doorway, briefly confused by the odd light and the smell.
                    &quot;Am I drunk?&quot; he asked.</font></b></font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font size="-1"><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Yeah,
                    you're drunk, all right&quot;.</font></b></font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font size="-1"><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Good;
                    I fucking deserve to be&quot;.</font></b></font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font size="-1"><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">An
                    old dentist chair sat in the center of the room. Cubby lurched
                    in, plopped down into it. He tore away his shirt and pants,
                    sat naked. He handed Ant a pad of paper from the Jena hotel.
                    &quot;How hard would that be?&quot;</font></b></font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font size="-1"><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ant
                    glanced at the pad, at the bloated, pasty, drying skin, but
                    not too closely. &quot;Easy or hard, that's how; like everything
                    else. Depends on what you're willing to settle for.&quot;</font></b></font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font size="-1"><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Cubby
                    displayed five thousand pesos in hundred-peso notes. That's
                    what he was willing to settle for. Ant had no qualms about
                    it; no matter the details. This was Cubby's seventh trip to
                    the studio; his seventh session. He knew the situation; it
                    never changed. Cubby was a good customer, and this would be
                    the final visit; neither one needed a Harvard education to
                    work that out. Still, it took Ant a little while to fire up
                    his enthusiasm; it took a candle, some brown dust, a red-capped
                    syringe to establish telepathic contact with his muse; but
                    finally, eyebrows knit, he knuckled down with his needle bar,
                    inscribing strange, polysyllabic names from the Jena pad onto
                    Cubby's skin, one by one, in odd, but precise calligraphy,
                    up an arm, down his back, the nape of his neck, on his leg,
                    on his crotch, winding between past souvenirs, other names
                    he'd scratched there in other sessions, names of young girls,
                    of expendable children, of men with beard stubble. Names that
                    drove the grammatical wife to distraction every time Cubby
                    disrobed. Cubby couldn't care less; these names were more
                    real than life. This time, Cubby wanted one on his hand, and
                    Ant balked a little, though not too much: he'd lost that argument
                    with clients before. &quot;It's what you show the world, you
                    know; and who knows what you're gonna have to do someday?
                    Like, you wouldn't get one on your face, would you?&quot;</font></b></font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font size="-1"><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Yes,&quot;
                    said Cubby.</font></b></font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font size="-1"><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Despite
                    his chronic state, Ant worked with consummate skill; there
                    were no stencils, and his strokes were long and relaxed and
                    deep and decisive. It took nearly three hours to get everything
                    down, every name. During that time, there was no sound but
                    the hum of the tattoo machine and the demented rooster shrilling
                    in the alley.</font></b></font></p>

                    day in, at check-out time, the desk boy kept his eyes averted;
                    the Jena manager grinned, &quot;...I hope chu enjoyed chore
                    stay, Mr. Deeler...&quot; with a big mouthful of Chief Wahoo
                    teeth, far too polite to mention the bloody bandages swaddling
                    Cubby bare, haggard arms, much too ingratiating to mention
                    Cubby's forehead, where 'Chucky Ley' was scratched in scabbed-over
                    orange letters; nor was there any fuss made when Cubby performed
                    his customary dry-out ritual, killing his seventh hotel goldfish;
                    pouring the remainder of his Don Cuervo stash into the aquarium
                    in the lobby. </font></b></font></p>
