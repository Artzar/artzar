                  <p align="left"><font size="-1"><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That
                    morning, third day in, his coterie toured a chassis assembly
                    line for a hands-on session. At the factory, they were on
                    to Cubby immediately; it was impossible to disguise forty
                    hours worth of marathon imbibing; Cubby's exhalations alone
                    could have powered the generator. But, all the contacts were
                    solicitous to him, overbearing and ingratiating.. &quot;...we
                    happreciate jore help, Mr. Deeler, we hope chu like Mexico...&quot;
                    as he stumbled grandly over pallets, dropped handfuls of thrust
                    bearings, gibbered Taco Bell Spanish, took occasional sips
                    from the tequila fifth stashed inside his sports coat. At
                    the midday break, they converged upon a famous beef restaurant
                    in Cuatitlan, where Cubby tried to play host. The group allowed
                    him and his gregarious stupor all the space he wanted, especially
                    the Orientals in their fierce blue suits, who couldn't drink
                    their way into anything resembling self-confidence or find
                    much on the menu that didn't intimidate them. They all drank
                    beer, wine, scotch, but Cubby was miles ahead, thirty feet
                    over them. When lunch ended, one of the entourage, a Harvard-educated
                    Mexican named Hervin Araiza, suggested that Cubby and he repair
                    to the cantina to let the Japanese jitterbugs carry on at
                    the plant. Araiza was a slender, boyish-looking man in his
                    mid-thirties, an expert on tulip plunging joints, and Cubby
                    joined him gladly, flattered, assuming that Araiza was impressed
                    with him. In fact, Cubby Diller was the cut of American that
                    Araiza most despised; despised with the sort of serene totality
                    reserved for old-school Latinos and the mentally ill. Together,
                    they fired up Cuban Cohibas and drank and drank and drank,
                    neat shots of some oily, sweet liqueur made from mandarin
                    oranges.</font></b></font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font size="-1"><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Araiza
                    spoke in measured tones, and nothing he said made the slightest
                    reference to driveshafts. It turned out that he was obsessed
                    with politics, politics being the easiest and most profitable
                    job in Mexico, and though he was ideologically vague, spouting
                    the party-line of a leftist intellectual while dressing in
                    the imported loafers and slick technofabrics of the Mexican
                    bourgeois, his true agenda cropped between the second and
                    third Mandarin; &quot;Mexico's a myth; you've heard that said?
                    But, it's a cohesive myth. That, combined with a crude sort
                    of realism makes up the legendary dichotomy of the people.
                    Determination and patience, those are our two greatest virtues;
                    and you see, they are not necessarily contradictions...&quot;</font></b></font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font size="-1"><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He
                    sat facing Cubby, who had no idea what he was talking about.
                    Araiza removed several five-by-seven photographs from his
                    briefcase and laid them on the bar in a careful line, facedown,
                    with only the Kodak logo showing. &quot;How strong's your
                    stomach, Mr. Diller?&quot;</font></b></font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font size="-1"><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Araiza's
                    sinister tone was lost on the goofy, shit-faced American,
                    who grinned, as though his companion was performing a card
                    trick. Araiza continued, calmly: &quot;There's six gentlemen
                    pictured here and one lady. Can you pick her out, without
                    looking?&quot;</font></b></font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font size="-1"><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Diller
                    screwed up his face and pointed to the last shot. &quot;Not
                    bad,&quot; said Araiza, flipping over the photograph. &quot;Most
                    people would have pointed to the middle one.&quot;</font></b></font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font size="-1"><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The
                    girl in the photo was about fifteen, wearing an expensive
                    party dress. She'd been dead for at least six months; there
                    was a bloodless bullet hole in her forehead, and her face
                    was completely mummified, striated and black; her mouth was
                    gaping open. Cubby stared down her surrealistic maw and counted
                    her teeth. Araiza said, &quot;They find these kinds of girls
                    in the desert all the time; they're party dolls from the traficantes,
                    they're used up and quickly discarded; we came upon this one
                    when we were searching for a manufacturer's rep from a sintered
                    metallics company out of New York. The rep was kidnapped on
                    a business trip to Mexico. His name was Manfred Muller, he
                    was from Syracuse. Here he is, number six...&quot;</font></b></font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font size="-1"><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Cubby
                    took the snapshot obediently, shocked into mechanics by the
                    mummy girl and her beautiful white teeth. The second picture
                    showed a hooded man holding a mini-Uzi equipped with a silencer;
                    he was standing over the body of a fat, dead executive-type
                    who was still wearing his peculiar blindfold, Rayban sunglasses
                    painted with nail polish. Here, there was plenty of blood,
                    and some plump blue sausages that were probably intestines.
                    Araiza flipped the other photos one by one. Each showed a
                    corpse, all well-dressed, some hog-tied, some dismembered.
                    One hung from the window of a blue Mercedes 190 with a bullet-riddled
                    face. &quot;Rental car; 9 mm. damage is not something normally
                    covered by Avis.&quot;</font></b></font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font size="-1"><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Cubby
                    blinked rapidly. His head was spinning: despite the gory pictures,
                    Araiza appeared to be making jokes. He gulped at his drink.
                    Incongruously, Jethro Tull came up on the sound system, punctuating
                    the tearful boleros. Araiza's voice remained steady, unruffled.
                    He went on: &quot;This is the handiwork work of the Union
                    Patri&#151;tico; a Tzeltale Indian group intending to be the
                    first post-Communist ethic uprising of the twenty-first century.
                    They're headquartered in Chiapas, but operate mostly here
                    the D.F., where the hunting's better. You see, they abduct
                    and execute foreign businessmen; Americans mainly, that's
                    their 'thing', their 'statement'. These assassinations are
                    not viewed as a long-term political strategy, but rather,
                    redress for five hundred years of exploitation. Already this
                    year? Sixteen. Six of the bodies were found by local army
                    units. The rest are still out there somewhere, turning to
                    leather in the desert. Being from Chiapas, originally, I am
                    obviously in a position at least to know what's going on,
                    though the guerillas tend to distrust anything having to do
                    with civil society. Not that one can't understand their viewpoint,
                    as I say; the President's credibility is not very high...
                    most recently, in an attempt to pacify the rebels, the federals
                    spent almost sixty million pesos building them basketball
                    courts.&quot; Araiza shook his head, bemused. &quot;Thousands
                    of concrete basketball courts, all across the country, each
                    with a ten- foot, regulation hoop. Only thing, Mexico's Indian
                    population averages five-foot-three. They work fourteen hours
                    a day, on hardly any food. And if that's not sadistic enough,
                    the only sport the Indians understand is soccer! That's the
                    only sport they want to play! They don't even know the rules
                    of basketball; you should watch them try to play it sometimes!
                    On their new, regulation-sized concrete courts! They all throw
                    underhanded, like grandmothers!&quot; </font></b></font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font size="-1"><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now,
                    clearly, slender Ariaza was trying to lighten things up. He
                    mugged and demonstrated the peasants' grandmotherly free-throw,
                    over and over again, until Cubby was poleaxed into the new
                    mood and began to chortle, mimicking Araiza's motion, tossing
                    an imaginary ball, upsetting the drinks and scattering the
                    corpse photographs onto the cool Saltillo tiles. Araiza gathered
                    them up quickly, patted them dry, and slipped them inside
                    a soot-colored envelope. He passed the envelope to Cubby,
                    murmuring gently, &quot;I would like you to take these images
                    back to your directives, please, Mr. Diller. They must understand
                    that a world exists down here beside cheap labor and talking
                    Chihuahuas.&quot;</font></b></font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font size="-1"><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Araiza
                    promptly paid the check, and at the door, smiling, turned
                    to Cubby and said, &quot;You know what I'm thinking? I'm thinking
                    I should make a business, negotiating with these terrorists,
                    these U.P. What's your opinion? Being from Chiapas, I grew
                    up with some of them. I'm Harvard educated, and they respect
                    that. They won't listen to reason, but like all men, they'll
                    listen to money. Me, I'm a free-market crusader. Mexicans
                    have a saying, Kindness is free, but it's not cheap. If companies
                    will continue to send top executives to Mexico, they might
                    someday need a mediator to save their lives. God forbid, VelCor
                    might wind up as my first client! Here, I will give you a
                    card to include with those terrible photographs, in case it
                    should ever become necessary. Who knows?&quot;</font></b></font></p>

                    handed Cubby his plunging joints business card, but on the
