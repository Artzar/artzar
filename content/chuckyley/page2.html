                  <p align="left"><font size="-1"><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now,
                    the second day in, from the window of the commandeered cab,
                    soundly drunk and outrageously happy, he surveyed the swirling
                    morass, the maelstrom of perpetually congested Reforma Boulevard.
                    There were all sorts of nightmares to be scrutinized here,
                    countless strata: tragic trumpets drilling through thick air,
                    smothering yellow smoke settling on the strange little suede-colored
                    people, each of whom, if you cared to key in on it, had some
                    serious flaw or another; an oozing burn, disproportionately
                    large ears, a lousy toupee, a gimp leg, a missing finger,
                    a clinging, deformed, half-naked child sucking on a way-ripe
                    mango. Who the fuck were these people, anyway? That's what
                    Cubby wanted to know. Quality was the problem down here, not
                    productivity: there was tons of street industry; bicycle carts
                    spinning through traffic, miniature chewing-gum salesmen asking
                    a peso per pop, a fire-eating clown- faced windshield-washing
                    beggar in a counterfeit CK Jeans cap, who at night became
                    a window- smashing robber... Idiotically inappropriate census
                    figures insured that here in reality-land, no job was too
                    menial, no pay scale too obscene; everywhere, somebody with
                    a rag or a squeegee was cleaning something; actually, they
                    were mostly cleaning the same things over and over and over
                    again, and yet in the aggregate, in their wake, there was
                    a profound sensation of filthiness. Not so remarkable, actually.
                    Because the function of these cleaners was to work, not to
                    make things clean. You could reach a similar conclusion over
                    an anthill, watching particle-shifting vermin skittering mindlesslessly,
                    purposefully, through losing battles against grains of sand.
                    On that level, both human and insect, the real insanity was
                    the fear, not of failure, but of final subsumation, of total
                    disappearance into the concept, which far from being irrational,
                    was probably inevitable.</font></b></font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font size="-1"><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So,
                    where was the significance in considering, over the course
                    of a day or two, ten thousand complicated individuals you
                    would never see again? That's what else he wanted to know.</font></b></font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font size="-1"><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Cubby's
                    mood was more fragile than he'd admit, and he cackled at the
                    Latin freak-show with growing uneasiness until his smile went
                    suddenly bankrupt. An old stake truck filled with leafy green
                    things and dour, shiny-trousered campesinos had edged suddenly
                    in beside the taxi, cutting off his view of the sidewalk;
                    and on the truck's door, opposite his face, a foot away, someone
                    had written 'Chucky Ley' in small, careful orange letters.
                    He scribbled down the weird, gringo name in his Franklin Planner;
                    then deflated. The juxtaposition of events, possibly unrelated:
                    the swarm of fucked-up mortals, the industrious preschoolers,
                    the palm trees, 'Chucky Ley' in small, careful orange letters,
                    caused such a melancholic eruption of emotion within Cubby
                    Diller that he broke down and wept while the cab driver eyed
                    him carefully in the mirror.</font></b></font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font size="-1"><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Later,
                    on the television in the hotel room, there was a local channel
                    running snapshots of missing persons, all sorts of missing
                    persons, all ages, all social castes; evidentially, nobody
                    in Mexico was immune to sudden disappearance. He watched in
                    bleary fascination, for an hour or more. The Missing Persons
                    Channel. What were the demographics? Either you were missing,
                    and knew it, or missed someone, and knew it; either way, how
                    did this help? Still, face after face appeared, reappeared
                    if you stayed tune long enough, some of desperately pretty
                    teenaged girls with glittering teeth, whose potential for
                    a new life of sexual bondage was heady and erotic; some of
                    little kids, who for all he knew, were bought and sold like
                    ripe mangoes in the fairs and markets; some of middle-aged,
                    out-of-focus, unshaven men such as never seemed to go missing
                    in the states, if you believed the milk cartons; some were
                    drawings of people who had vanished and looked like nine of
                    the next ten strangers you'd pass on the boulevard; but all
                    had genuine lives, individual cycles, distinct circulatory
                    systems, private disgraces, personal passions, dreams, talents,
                    and most had three or four names that somebody had, with circumspection,
                    bestowed upon them once, not suspecting how badly it would
                    turn out. Now, that was the biggest mystery; that was the
                    sort of realization that made Cubby want to vomit. And he
                    couldn't get enough of it. He jotted down the funny, polysyllabic
                    Mexican names with a Jena pen on a Jena pad. He drank tequila
                    until he fell asleep, and when he woke up, the grainy, unfocused,
                    funny-named individuals were still flashing across the screen
                    in an endless loop, each one of them still MIA; he'd been
                    out cold for at least six hours, during which, not one of
                    those poor people had turned up.</font></b></font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font size="-1"><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He'd
                    drained the minibar of all the brown liquor, for which he
                    had a preference but not a requirement, and now, he started
                    in on the rums and vodkas, then polished off the Tecates and
                    Sols along with the remains of the American Burger that room
                    service had delivered prior to calling it a night, and by
                    the time the rest of the hotel was stirring, showering, tightening
                    ties, setting out, hitting the breakfast buffet, Cubby was
                    bombastically boiled and unreasonably ecstatic, ready for
                    another round.</font></b></font></p>
