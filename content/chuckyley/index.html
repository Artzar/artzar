                    do you do with a life? Given one, beyond the odds. Consider
                    the goldfish in the hotel lobby, swimming endless, monotonous
                    circuits inside a glass tank. Can't even sleep, that goldfish.
                    What's the deal with fish not being able to sleep? Does God
                    hate goldfish? No sex, no booze, no Superbowl (maybe the one
                    it gets flushed down); it's a wonder God even lets them die.
                    Call this a life? Around and around he goes, that little goldfish,
                    the worst delirium nightmare imaginable, endless geometrical
                    deja vu; even a rat trapped inside a maze has purpose; a clear,
                    if futile impetus; that is, to escape. But to the goldfish,
                    there's no escape; incessant, delirious orbits is reality
                    in all it's potential savor. </font> </b></font></div>

                    seventh collapse of sobriety happened inside the Jena Inn,
                    in Mexico City, across the plaza from the Hotel Garbage. The
                    shrieking magenta neon Hotel Garbage sign struck Cubby Diller
                    as hilarious from his tenth floor Jena Inn balcony. Six airline-sized
                    Don Cuervos... a Hotel Garbage sign... and Cubby Diller was
                    as near to grasping postmodern ironies as could be managed
                    by his thick, sodden, vague, mechanical brain. At the time
                    (seven in the evening, first day in), the name 'Hotel Garbage'
                    was, to him, a big fucking laugh. He figured it was the result
                    of some pretentious Mexican's pidgin grasp of English, and
                    he guffawed and shook his head over and over and over and
                    over, though in the morning, still drinking, and somehow less
                    confused, he realized that the sign said 'Hotel Garage' and
                    was actually a parking structure meant for those Jena patrons
                    with balls enough to wield vehicles through that raw, congested
                    labyrinth. The city was a little slice of hell, ringed by
                    volcanoes, battered by earthquakes, slowly sinking into a
                    massive lake bed; there was cholera in the aquifers, amebic
                    dysentery in the lettuce, lysteria in the chalupas, retroviruses
                    in the prostitutes, thieves in the waiters, and as for the
                    cops, don't even go there... might as well treat them like
                    the Lions Club panhandlers hawking flags at the red lights
                    and pay them off as soon as they approach, without waiting
                    for the details.</font></b></font></p>

                    day in, feeling lucid for the first time in three months,
                    his head as clear as the sky beyond the manila-colored soot-canopy,
                    maintaining his expansive mood, Cubby commandeered a cab,
                    and headed toward a business meeting at the Crowne Plaza,
                    across town. He was utterly tuned into every moment during
                    that cab ride, the minutiae of every moment. Born again. He
                    could subdivide each moment into an endless series of increments.
                    Each passerby seethed, an individual metropolis, an infinite
                    sequence of glittery contractions. Broad, perpetual, counterfeit
                    grins hung on everybody everywhere, big as the one on the
                    Cleveland Indian mascot. Everybody was teeth! So vibrant,
                    extant. So wise. The men all wore green and red flags in their
                    lapels and cast Cubby looks of: 'Don't think I'm not on to
                    your game'.</font></b></font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font size="-1"><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Cubby's
                    game was extremely complex, far more elaborate than he himself
                    understood. It was an obscure, subterranean performance; it
                    welled from a mystery fountain, like the one from which Samuel
                    Coleridge dredged Kublai Khan while sleeping; and in Cubby,
                    it made itself manifest three or four times each year, when
                    VelCor Bearings (his employer), sent him to Mexico to sort
                    out hysterical quality blips. VelCor manufactured guts that
                    animated automotive driveshafts throughout the civilized world,
                    but there were several insulating tiers of sub-assemblers
                    between VelCor and the big players, the car builders, so these
                    trips were basically meant to offer a show of commitment and
                    a bit of technical support, and were not particularly difficult
                    to handle. Otherwise, Diller would not have gone. He would
                    not have been capable. But the small VelCor office was in
                    Akron, and everybody else in it, chalky, tubby, naive Caucasians,
                    had an irrational fear of Mexico. Cubby Diller, for a number
                    of reasons, did not suffer from this particular phobia, this
                    aversion; at least, not to the point of physical debility.
                    So Diller was the body that went to represent the VelCor viewpoint
                    during the hysterics. Every time.</font></b></font></p>

                    than that, he was a pea for the thrust-bearing industry pod;
                    fifty-six years old; overweight, half- blind, hypnotically
                    unambitious; he'd spent the past thirty-five years doing a
                    sad rustbelt manufacturing ladder-climb, going from an existence
                    of intolerable brutality to one of tolerable dullness, from
                    twelve hour stamping-plant shifts, through union ultimatums,
                    seniority default promotions, mercy raises, to a floppy, non-vital,
                    and largely undeserved white-collar engineering gig with an
                    office and a Palm Pilot. He considered himself both untalented
                    and tremendously fortunate to earn what he earned, and he
                    was right: he did nothing throughout the course of his days
                    but give occasional, unsound, ultimately ignored advice to
                    much younger CAD designers. He had a ghastly wife who corrected
                    his grammar, two grown children to whom he hadn't spoken in
                    a long time, a Lawnboy, a split-level in Cumberland Heights,
                    a mobile home on Northern Michigan acreage, a 401k worth maybe
                    a hundred thousand. He had a low- def, but expensive Magnavox
                    and a preference for A&amp;E shows on Vietnam (an engagement
                    from which he'd been exempted: lousy eyesight); he kept an
                    old list of MIA's in a bureau drawer, and on occasion, he
                    pored over the names with a peculiar, ineffable rapture, perplexed
                    and intrigued by a system where men could melt away, dissolve,
                    leave no trace. Otherwise, his existence moved forward without
                    the slightest tint of technicolor. He rambled through each
                    of his allotted increments, a dutiful myrmidon. He had no
                    particular dreams. No gifts, no outrageous passions. He coveted
                    nothing, neither his neighbor's goods nor his wife. (In fact,
                    he hadn't thought about poontang subjectively since 1984).
                    All his shirts had armpit ovals. He attended weekend Christian
                    Fellowship retreats at Lake Lavigne. The only Byronic, non-predictable,
                    exciting thing he'd ever done was to drunk-drive a blue Dodge
                    150 into a service transformer at six o'clock one morning
                    and emerge without two of his teeth. From the hospital, in
                    lieu of jail, he'd headed to a series of court-mandated, VelCor-financed,
                    personally-welcomed AA moments, and since then, he'd mostly
                    steered clear of hooch and transformers.</font></b></font></p>

                    fact, AA moments were little and late; his career was very
                    nearly over by then and his position would evaporate with
                    the next fiscal downsizing. If he sensed it, he didn't let
                    on. In the meantime, he'd go eagerly to the altar when the
                    automotive Aztecs wanted a sacrifice. From Cleveland to Columbus
                    to Dallas to Mexico; a long day up and down. He spent every
                    minute of it in a kind of Pavlovian dipsomaniacal frenzy,
                    waiting for the final touchdown: he'd worked out his suburban
                    alcoholism so effectively that he scarcely found any temptations
                    in Akron, not inside familiar bars, not inside Vat 69 billboards,
                    not inside hi-tech Miller ads; but these occasional business
                    trips to Mexico had become his pressure cock, and since nothing
                    much was required of him at the meetings, where the reports
                    were generally given by overdressed men from Japan, and he
                    didn't find anything even slightly perplexing in himself falling
                    off the wagon with both feet, several times a year, directly
                    onto the dusty Aeropuerto tarmac.</font></b></font></p>
