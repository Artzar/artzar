                    four a.m., Gabe woke to a thunderous banging on his front 
                    door. As he rose, he slipped slightly on the puddle of drool 
                    he left on the kitchen tile floor, where he had dropped after 
                    consuming Ana's pills. Regaining some of his direction, he 
                    proceeded to the front door and opened it without checking 
                    the peephole. </font></font> </p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222"> 
                    He just caught a glimpse of the two figures in the light before 
                    the bare bulb above the entranceway was unscrewed and extinguished. 
                    He barely steadied himself on the ripped wire mesh of the 
                    front screen door and tried to make them out, mist from the 
                    bay rising around their feet.</font> </p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222"> 
                    A bagged body was being held upright by a young man with a 
                    shaved head and pins stuck through his cheeks and chin. Gabe 
                    pulled his glasses down from the top of his forehead and gained 
                    enough clarity to notice that the body was wrapped in a dirty 
                    sack from head to toe and held tight by thick ropes.</font>

                    Then the boy spoke, thickly: &quot;Here is your wife, Mr. 
                    Nolan. Now where is my money.&quot;</font></p>
                  <p>&nbsp;</p>

                    following morning, unusually cloudy with dim gray light, he 
                    met his Navy buddies at Starbucks, as was their daily routine 
                    since the coffeshop opened on Webster Ave, when Ana went into 
                    the hospital for the first and final time.</font> </p>

                    Sandy, Lou and Gabe were the USS Hornet's chief officers, 
                    and since the carrier was decommissioned, it lay like a huge 
                    steel tomb only a few miles from the Starbucks, out by the 
                    old navy yards.</font> </p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222"> 
                    Gabe arrived late, as he already consumed a few cups of coffee 
                    at home to sweep clean the brain fuzz and muscle ache from 
                    last night's exertions. He heard them shouting to him as soon 
                    as he entered. Sandy waved a fresh cup of coffee like a pendulum, 
                    tempting him since walking straight was still a burden.</font> 
                  </p>
                  <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222">&quot;Remember 
                    that time when&#133;&quot; began all their conversations. 
                    Today's version continued: &quot;I gave that South American 
                    girl her first puppy&#133;&quot;</font> </p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222"> 
                    Gabe hauled himself over the offered chair, but only breathed 
                    in the aroma, feeling seasick. He straightened as the coffee 
                    had its effect, and stared at his friends, their voices a 
                    soothing drawl that he welcomed. Lou wore his usual plaid 
                    shirt with suspenders and Sandy floated in the oversized gray 
                    pants, black socks and stained brown leather shoes slightly 
                    big for his rapidly shrinking feet. All in the beginning stages 
                    of evaporation as if aging were sucking out their marrow. 
                    They both wore red caps showing white hair thin to scalp.</font> 
                  </p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222"> 
                    Sandy stared at Gabe intently as Lou continued his monologue.</font> 
                  </p>
                  <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222">&quot;She 
                    was in room 23, which is the day I was born, I told her, and 
                    she actually laughed at me.&quot;</font> </p>
                  <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222">&quot;Oh, 
                    Christ, not the whore-from-Panama story again,&quot; Gabe 
                    wearily and flatly stated.</font> </p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222"> 
                    Seeing his silent partners, Lou caught the sense to shut his 
                    mouth, and looked through thick glasses at Gabe.</font> </p>
                  <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222">&quot;We 
                    are both really sorry about Ana.&quot;</font> </p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222"> 
                    Gabe looked at Lou, and took crystal clear notes on every 
                    aspect of him, as if suddenly a microscope had been held up 
                    to his eye. He had been seeing people this way for days since 
                    Ana died. None of the details that he had skipped over in 
                    the past were spared him now. He had been removing his glasses 
                    often to resort to a blurring that helped the hours pass without 
                    migraines.</font> </p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222"> 
                    Lou's cap was hanging at a jaunty angle, papers stuffed in 
                    his pocket of plaid short sleeved shirt, striped suspenders 
                    loose over his thick chest. He had a habit of picking with 
                    long fingers at the palm of his hands, like an earthmover 
                    tilling dry and cracked soil.</font> </p>
                  <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222">&quot;Well, 
                    you know that there is a way to assure that she will stay 
                    with you for the rest of your days.&quot;</font> </p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222"> 
                    Gabe was stoic and betrayed no response to this bait.</font> 
                  </p>
                  <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222">&quot;Oh, 
                    come on, Gabe, you remember the instructions.&quot;</font> 
                  </p>
                  <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222">&quot;I 
                    don't know what you are talking about,&quot; Gabe responded 
                    and brought the coffee cup to his lips, but stopped before 
                    sipping.</font> </p>
                  <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222">&quot;You 
                    know full well, the cook on the Hornet. He told us back in 
                    '45 as we crossed the equator.&quot;</font> </p>
                  <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222">&quot;Again, 
                    I don't know what you are talking about, Lou. And that is 
                    final.&quot;</font> </p>
                  <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222">&quot;Just 
                    that he told us something that might help you now, like he 
                    helped Hattie and me.&quot;</font> </p>
                  <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222">&quot;God 
                    bless her soul,&quot; Sandy intoned, while nervously straightening 
                    his lemon-colored bowtie.</font> </p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222"> 
                    Gabe threw back the chair, knocking it to the floor, and stormed 
                    out of the coffeeshop.</font> </p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222"> 
                    For the mile walk back to the house, and through the dense 
                    blackness of his rage, he only allowed two thoughts to pierce 
                    the blanketing.</font> </p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222">

                    But I refuse to allow them to touch Ana, he decided, while 
                    gingerly walking over the fresh soft soil in his backyard 
                    beneath which lay her remains.</font> </p>
