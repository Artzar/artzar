                    let's get this straight, gramps.&quot;</font></p>

                    The police officer was unbearably young, so what could HE 
                    know of a love that lasts a lifetime and beyond? Gabe stared 
                    at the teenage cop. Throwing his long hair around, constantly 
                    touching himself to keep the buzz of his youth going full 
                    blast and deaf to anything above the din of his rushing blood.</font></p>
                  <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222">&quot;Last 
                    night you dug up the bones of your wife and this morning we 
                    found them in a sack behind your apartment.&quot;</font></p>
                  <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222">&quot;Yes, 
                    I'm not denying that.&quot;</font></p>
                  <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222">&quot;But 
                    what the hell for?&quot;</font></p>
                  <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222">&quot;What 
                    time is it, please?&quot;</font></p>
                  <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222">&quot;Don't 
                    bother about that, you have plenty of time to come up with 
                    a good reason.&quot;</font></p>
                  <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222">&quot;I 
                    need to know NOW!&quot;</font></p>
                  <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222">&quot;Don't 
                    get so agitated, it's only around quarter of twelve am.&quot;</font></p>
                  <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222">&quot;Oh, 
                    you must let me go immediately or there will be no hope for 
                    me and her&#133;&quot;</font></p>
                  <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222">&quot;What 
                    is SO important about the time?&quot;</font></p>

                    will never understand, it's the only thing that will keep 
                    her with me.&quot;</font></p>
                  <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222">&quot;Looks 
                    like you already tried that once, pops.&quot;</font></p>
                  <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222">&quot;I'm 
                    begging you, let me go, and I'll come back later and answer 
                    all your questions.&quot;</font></p>
                  <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222">&quot;No, 
                    we need to do this now! What were you going to do with the 
                    bones?&quot;</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222"> 
                    Gabe looked into the astonishingly clear and cold eyes of 
                    the youth and took in all of his reflections and his shined 
                    to a chromium polish uniform and saw the folly in continuing.</font></p>
                  <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222">&quot;Gabe, 
                    you look harmless. Did you love your wife?&quot;</font></p>
                  <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222">&quot;Why 
                    the hell are you asking me that?&quot;</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222"> 
                    Then the tears flowed. </font></p>
                  <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222">&quot;I 
                    miss her more than you can imagine, but it is that religious 
                    zealot her sister that wants to drag her down to hell with 
                    her.&quot;</font></p>
                  <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222">&quot;Whoa, 
                    gramps, you're getting all worked up over nothing.&quot;</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222"> 
                    I hope he distracts easily, Gabe prayed. All of his generation 
                    do. But he was suddenly called out of the room, and the door 
                    didn't shut all the way, the teen cop being too preoccupied 
                    with walking &quot;cool&quot; to notice.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222"> 
                    Gabe dashed out of the police station and into his Dodge, 
                    cranking it up full, and went winding through traffic to drive 
                    up to the Marina just as the clock hit 12:02pm.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222"> 
                    He saw the last moment of the spirits shimmering across the 
                    bay, the clouds forming faces and bodies. He caught the exquisite 
                    sight of the curve of Ana's high cheekbones and the curious 
                    way that she tilted her head as if listening to an inner voice.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222"> 
                    Then he saw the arms entwining, Ana and Claudia, who was finally 
                    leading her away, hand in hand.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222"> 
                    He fell to his knees, the soft earth giving way as he sunk 
                    into the soil, cursing his fate and feeling the crushing of 
                    loneliness eking the life out of him. </font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222"> 
                    He remained there until the police dragged him away.</font></p>
                  <p>&nbsp;</p>

                    brother-in-law came to pay his fine, and also arranged for 
                    the proper burial of Ana's bones.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222"> 
                    There was a voicemail message when Gabe finally returned to 
                    his tiny studio apartment late that night. </font></p>

                    Two voices that eventually blended into one.</font></p>

                    beloved wife, do you know what she did? The slut. She screwed 
                    around with MY boyfriend that summer, as though she couldn't 
                    get her own. He was tainted goods when I married him, but 
                    I redeemed him. In time. Now I need to do the same with Ana.&quot;</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222"> 
                    The second voice, clearer than she had sounded in the past 
                    years of illness: &quot;My baby, my love. I am going. You 
                    won't see me anymore in the reflections. Or feel me next to 
                    you on our bench. I am taking my sister, and we are going 
                    together. It is meant to be. She will be taken care of, as 
                    will I. I will wait for you to join us.&quot; </font></p>
