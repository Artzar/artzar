                  Nolan returned from burying his wife of forty years, and all 
                  that he desired was to be alone in the house they made for each 
                  other. Most of the funeral guests understood, and looked sympathetically 
                  at Gabe who had already begun to slowly undress and slip into 
                  a state described by one in a single whispered word: &quot;lost.&quot;</font></font> 
                  <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#222222">&quot;Of 
                    course I am lost without Ana, what do ya expect?&quot; he 
                    mumbled, waving away hugs and condolences, and led the small 
                    gathering of mostly her friends out of the house. He had stripped 
                    down to his T-shirt, halfway relieving himself of the burden 
                    of the ill-fitting suit. Having removed his shoes and socks, 
                    his bare feet traveled the nuances of the wood flooring and 
                    assuredly found familiar nicks and holes.</font> 
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#222222"> 
                    Giving invitation to exit, he opened the front screen door, 
                    which was shrouded in black cloth like most of the windows. 
                    For a sun-worshipper, Ana was ironically plagued in the last 
                    stages of her illness to an extreme sensitivity to light. 
                    As the small crowd passed Gabe, the most dreaded fell to the 
                    back of the line: a towering sister somebody of the local 
                    church which they never attended, and Gabe strained to stretch 
                    open the door in consideration of her fleshiness. He welcomed 
                    breezes off the bay that vented the staining sweat under her 
                    massive arms. </font> 
                  <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#222222">&quot;She 
                    has crossed the border to Jesus now. Isn't she lucky?&quot; 
                    she chirped.</font> 
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#222222"> 
                    Gabe dug his fingernails into the screen door, puncturing 
                    weak sections of the wire mesh. Why did this worshipper show 
                    up uninvited? Gritting his teeth, he responded grimly, &quot;She 
                    will always be with me, spirit and bone, in EVERY WAY, sister,&quot; 
                    and was pleased to see her dumbfounded expression.</font> 
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#222222"> 
                    After locking the front door, he reluctantly turned about 
                    face in the foyer and gazed across at the wall covered with 
                    a thick sheet of black tarp. Damn the reminders. He lifted 
                    it and exposed dozens of framed photos, kept hidden from Ana's 
                    sight, since reflections off the gold and silver drove her 
                    into panics. Photos of them as a couple, with only one of 
                    a teenage Ana, alone, taken on a trip to Rhode Island.</font> 
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#222222"> 
                    Gabe drew close to this one, examining it while unloosening 
                    tears. Ana stood on a beach wearing a sized small sundress 
                    splashed in a furious pattern of bright dots. Ana hated this 
                    photo, with her glum expression and ill-fitting tight outfit.</font> 
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#222222"> 
                    For the first time, he noticed the long shadow in the background 
                    behind Ana that was cut off by the frame. It almost appeared 
                    to have been painted in, or placed over something. Trick of 
                    my sight, he reasoned, and wiped the tears from his sunken 
                    cheeks. </font> 
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#222222"> 
                    Interlacing his fingers into the tall gate that separated 
                    the living room from the foyer, Gabe suddenly craved for the 
                    comfort of the clouded vision that was the effect of Ana's 
                    medicine, which he had been taking since her death. His knuckles 
                    strained white in keeping upright one hundred and forty pounds 
                    of dried and dispirited flesh stretched thin and leathery 
                    like beef jerky.</font> 
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#222222"> 
                    He let his tight pants fall to his ankles and waded across 
                    the living room, like a waddling baby's first steps. He reached 
                    the garage door and fumbled to open it with the mass confusion 
                    of keys that he now had to carry.</font> 
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#222222"> 
                    His workroom off the garage was one of the few areas that 
                    really fit his tall stature. Throughout most of the house 
                    he had to lean down to embrace Ana, and stoop to glide past 
                    the gently curved arches. </font> 
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#222222"> 
                    At the moment of slumping onto the stool at his workbench, 
                    crowded with candle holders that he had been trying to glue 
                    together for illuminating the hallways for Ana's return, he 
                    heard a sharp snap coming from the kitchen, followed by the 
                    cycling of a motor.</font> 
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#222222"> 
                    Who the hell had left THAT on?</font> 
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#222222"> 
                    He rushed into the kitchen and saw that the double closet 
                    doors had been opened and the dryer behind it was jostling 
                    in the cramped space. He shut it off and opened the lid, his 
                    hands warming in the clean air. Fishing inside, he pulled 
                    out his white shirt that had stained with the pen used to 
                    write down her words for reciting at the burial. No priest 
                    or religious words were her eulogy demands. Just retelling 
                    of sunny predictions from high school yearbook, most of them 
                    having come to pass. Except being childless. His fault. </font> 
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#222222"> 
                    Looking down at his hands, he willed the incessant shaking 
                    to cease. He upturned his palms to shine in the brilliant 
                    fluorescent of the kitchen lights. And he wept into them.</font> 
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#222222"> 
                    Gabe and Ana held hands together at every occasion, and especially 
                    in bed, every night. Like schoolkids in the first throes of 
                    love. He thought to replicate the feeling with rubbing his 
                    hands together, but why betray it?</font> 
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#222222"> 
                    Staggering backward, he scrambled to look vainly for Ana's 
                    medicine, and began to sink into the rottenness that her presence 
                    had always been able to keep at bay. Need to look to the basement 
                    and see if those old bottles were still there, hidden from 
                    the past months of her illness, when he had picked them up 
                    to cope. </font> 
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#222222"> 
                    He stumbled into a stack of pamphlets that he was sure he'd 
                    dumped into the garbage last night. Someone piled them back 
                    up, accumulated since she died; religious pamphlets with the 
                    same extremely crude, childish drawings on the front. All 
                    of the figures were rosy cheeked as if satiated from vampire 
                    sucking, Gabe thought, disgusted at how they infiltrated his 
                    mail so relentlessly.</font> 
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#222222"> 
                    Gabe kept calling these people to cancel his subscription. 
                    And their answer, delivered in the honeyed whisper resulting 
                    from a thousand tongues speaking through them: &quot;Lucky 
                    you, since an anonymous patron has graced you with a lifetime 
                    subscription.&quot;</font> 
                  <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#222222">&quot;Then 
                    consider me dead,&quot; he responded.</font>
