                    the next months, Gabe transitioned from open weeping to a 
                    general numbness and opacity that would only dissipate when 
                    he warmed to a certain reassurance that at some point during 
                    the day he would see Ana.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222"> 
                    The glass patio doors were almost a guarantee, and Gabe would 
                    make it a point at noon to gaze at the glass every time he 
                    opened the doors.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222"> 
                    And she would be there, a vision within the sunray, a searing 
                    glint giving dimension and form to her profile.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222"> 
                    But just as she grinned, he would inevitably shift in his 
                    stooping and the sight would vanish into whiteness.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222"> 
                    He lived in the wake of sensations and moments of full clarity 
                    that she was still with him. The key was the daily routines, 
                    and that was what kept his nature on a short leash.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222"> 
                    He kept the appointments, the charity balls, neighborhood 
                    walkarounds and breakfasts at the Starbucks on Webster Ave 
                    with Lou and Sandy. His strict napping schedule and evening 
                    stroll around Jack London Square to sit for hours on their 
                    favorite bench. </font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222"> 
                    It took him a while to notice that the moments of strongest 
                    disconnection with Ana's spirit came whenever he would be 
                    around certain objects. When he passed the glass cabinet that 
                    contained the porcelain china cups and dishes decorated with 
                    delicately drawn images of the Prince and Princess of Monaco 
                    drawn in the crystal clarity of a Mediterranean sun. Next 
                    to the boat replicas carved in delicate balsa wood from Rhode 
                    Island.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222"> 
                    In early June, when the breezes off the bay took the edge 
                    off the heatwave that plunged Alameda into yet another drought 
                    warning, he sat on the bench under the protective shadow of 
                    an umbrella. Gabe opened up a scrapbook that was at the bottom 
                    of the dozen or so photobooks that he had been slowly leafing 
                    through.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222"> 
                    This book actually made a noise as he opened it, pages stuck 
                    together, spine cracking from unnatural motion. It had some 
                    dates at the start, and appeared to be one of the first scrapbooks 
                    that Ana had kept. Evidence in her tiny, but still very self-assured 
                    hand when writing exact dates, and even times, to the album.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222"> 
                    It began with high school photos. Ana was the prize of Lincoln 
                    Park High. &quot;You were a quiet beauty, Ana, my sweet,&quot; 
                    he whispered, and warmed to the sense of her presence next 
                    to him on the bench.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222"> 
                    But suddenly there was only coldness, and he looked up at 
                    that. No one around him to disturb them, and a silence that 
                    was suddenly disconcerting.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222"> 
                    She was just here&#133;and now she flees?</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222"> 
                    The breezes off the bay ceased, as clamminess crept through 
                    his thick, hand-sewn sweater.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222"> 
                    He returned to the photo album. The scribbling along the photos 
                    got sloppier and jagged as he came upon a section of photos 
                    about a summer that she spent in Rhode Island. And there was 
                    the photo that was framed in their hallway of Ana in the sundress.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222"> 
                    But the shadow next to her was gone. Replaced with the image 
                    of another teenager, who appeared older than Ana, and in contrast 
                    to her fit effortlessly in a loose-fitting dark dress that 
                    she lit up with a brilliant crescent-moon smile. Her eyes 
                    were covered in teardrop shaped sunglasses.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222"> 
                    He realized that it was someone else's handwriting that he 
                    was reading. No wonder the whole tone changed. Intense scrutiny 
                    on this text made his eyes ache, but he narrowed them to a 
                    slit to focus.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222"> 
                    Who was this girl, whose features resembled Ana but in a funhouse 
                    distortion? Where Ana was short, this woman towered, though 
                    with fleshy build. Her writing was brief, vague. Odd comments 
                    like &quot;finding our souls&quot; and &quot;taking all this 
                    away from me.&quot;</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222"> 
                    But the telltale word was in capital letters, and the last 
                    of the comments scrawled. Reading it, Gabe sensed his wife's 
                    presence fleeing. This was followed by the crushing tonnage 
                    of loneliness that stuck a spike directly into his soul.</font></p>
                  <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222">&quot;Sister&quot; 
                    was the word.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222"> 
                    He closed the scrapbook and tried to shake the puzzlement 
                    from his face, not quickly recovering from the shock of his 
                    discovery. He immediately returned to their home, cracked 
                    open all their boxes in storage, scouring the yellowed memorabilia. 
                    But no further evidence of Ana's sister was to be found, except 
                    when he removed the frame from the hallway photo and found 
                    a name badly erased on the inside: Claudia.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222"> 
                    And he did unearth from beneath a pile of old newspapers a 
                    tightly sealed box which required a cleaver to cut loose choking 
                    string and violently spread masking tape. Inside was an assortment 
                    of religious relics, such as crucifixes and rosaries.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222"> 
                    So when the basement area got severely flooded the next week, 
                    he let the water sit there, knowing it would seep into the 
                    photo albums and crucifixes and vials of holy water; all &quot;gifts&quot; 
                    from Claudia. He relished the resulting rusting and crumbling 
                    of evidence Gabe knew Ana wanted to be submerged.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222"> 
                    She would've liked it better that way, he decided, and patted 
                    the seat next to him on the loveseat couch for her to join 
                    him in watching their favorite home improvement shows. And 
                    back Ana was, glinting through the sunlight reflections off 
                    the shades, joining him in dreaming of the changes that would 
                    never be made to the house they shared.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222"> 
                    But he forgot to return to the basement the scrapbook from 
                    the high school years, so it remained in the upstairs pile 
                    of the photo albums of their wedding, marriage, and old age.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222"> 
                    A week after the discovery, realization, and burial of Claudia's 
                    evidence, the call came from his lawyer.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222"> 
                    As he mentioned Claudia's name, Gabe blanked out for several 
                    seconds, and he almost lost hearing when he stated that she 
                    was alive and now contesting Ana's will. So the firestorm 
                    that had smoldered unseen for years had now caught as if a 
                    brushfire to consume him and Ana.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222"> 
                    Claudia found and nurtured an obscure loophole that she knew 
                    was there until Ana passed on, and now, with all the Old Testament 
                    fierceness of God's retribution, she used it to take to her 
                    logical conclusion.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222"> 
                    He had ten days to vacate the house.</font></p>
