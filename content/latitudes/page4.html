                    was the catalyst for long-dormant drinking he had been waiting 
                    for. And it now burst out into the open, unfettered and without 
                    his wife to temper it, and all routines fell into their dark 
                    alternative. For every fun bridge session at the retirement 
                    center, he nursed his hard liquor alone at home as the winter 
                    rains flooded gutters and burst into the basement, unheeded.

                    Two days before his eviction, he gave the shaved-headed boy 
                    a call. He needed him to dig, then bury again.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222"> 
                    And at that moment, it finally occurred to Gabe the identity 
                    of the odd woman at his wife's funeral that he had previously 
                    only seen around the church. &quot;Crossing the border to 
                    Jesus,&quot; Claudia had said then, as a promise. Or threat.</font></p>
                  <p>&nbsp;</p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222"><img src="/content/latitudes/graphics/chap6.gif" width="87" height="79" align="left">Gabe 
                    moved into the only apartment that he could afford; a tiny 
                    studio in the shadow of a large condo development in Ballena 
                    Bay, a picturesque enclave by the east shore of the bay.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222"> 
                    After the movers left, their accumulated belongings of forty 
                    years had been reduced to a dozen of so boxes, with cardboard 
                    walls buckling in moistness of their basement hideaway. All 
                    crammed into the single room. </font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222"> 
                    It took a month for Gabe to adjust to this new home before 
                    he took a long ride to Jack London Square to reclaim Ana's 
                    presence, and the scrapbook he brought along was of the high 
                    school years, but he realized this too late as he cracked 
                    it open. Intrigued, he kept looking for want of explaining 
                    a mystery.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222"> 
                    What happened that summer when they were in their late teens? 
                    He couldn't tell much by the scrapbook, except that it was 
                    after they graduated high school, and their parents had sent 
                    them up to Rhode Island to stay with aunt and uncle.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222"> 
                    He opened the pages and had to carefully pry the photos apart, 
                    glued together through water, tears or sweat. Unfortunately, 
                    only patches of the photos were spared as he wrenched them 
                    free, and he finally saw the face that had been shunned.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222"> 
                    Initially the two sisters didn't look at all similar. Where 
                    Ana was blond, her older sister's hair was dark and her eyebrows 
                    like strong slashes across a broad forehead. Looking at the 
                    two of them side by side, he was caught by the fact that although 
                    the shade was on Claudia's face, her smile shined through. 
                    In contrast, Ana's face was in full force of the summer sun, 
                    but wore a disturbed and cloudy expression, a dark purpose 
                    behind the grimace.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222"> 
                    When Gabe returned from Jack London Square, he stood at the 
                    voice recorder, and played back the messages that he knew 
                    were there. But as he pressed down on the switch, he saw that 
                    there were nine voicemails.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222"> 
                    Since the time of her death, Gabe had kept the last series 
                    of eight voicemails that Ana had left for him. Like opening 
                    up the windows to freshen the air, hearing her voice coated 
                    his depression with a salve of the sweetest melody.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222"> 
                    He played back the eight voicemails, but was distracted by 
                    the mystery of the ninth. Who could have left him a message? 
                    It must have been in the past hour, while he was at Jack London 
                    Square. He made strict instructions to his lawyers and the 
                    few friends he still kept in touch with, that they should 
                    write to him. He didn't want to risk erasing her voice.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222"> 
                    Finally the ninth message clicked on. </font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222"> 
                    Static for the longest while, until he began to panic that 
                    this was a wrong number and they left the phone off the hook, 
                    and it would eat up all of the remaining tape on the spool.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222"> 
                    Then he heard the voice, and knew it was Claudia.</font></p>
                  <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222">&quot;I 
                    am coming&#133;&quot;</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222"> 
                    Her voice was froggy and cracked with the weight and force 
                    of her intense emotions, as if summoning the words directly 
                    from the deepest pit of her hatred.</font></p>
                  <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222">&quot;&#133;I 
                    am coming for her tomorrow&#133;&quot;</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222"> 
                    His panic slid into frenzied heartbeats as he listened to 
                    this hot poker of a voice stab him repeatedly.</font></p>
                  <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222">&quot;&#133;at 
                    the marina, noontime&#133;&quot;</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222"> 
                    Then the line clicked silent. </font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222"> 
                    Gabe sank to the floor, and the feeling he had was that all 
                    of the elastic and connections and ligaments that held his 
                    arms and legs together had disappeared and he fell like a 
                    tumbling sack. He blacked out, as the recordings were automatically 
                    erased; all evidence gone. Except for the searing wound in 
                    the pit of his stomach that had registered the voice of Claudia.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222"> 
                    When he awoke and revived his strength, he checked the calendar 
                    to be sure.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222"> 
                    Yes, Claudia had been dead for two weeks. His lawyer told 
                    him just after he moved that she had a massive stroke while 
                    in a confessional at her church.</font></p>
