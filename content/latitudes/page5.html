                    Lou advised first: &quot;Follow the instructions; it is the 
                    only way.&quot;</font></p>
                  <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222">&quot;It

                  <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222">&quot;Just 
                    get her bones, and make sure you're not late to the appointed 
                    hour,&quot; Sandy warned.</font></p>

                    rose at 4:00am, as was his usual routine. Sensing the need 
                    to cast out the shadows, he rolled the patio doors open and 
                    searched vainly for Ana's reflection in the glass as the sun 
                    rose. But no reassurance could be found.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222"> 
                    He set up the fan to blow the moldy scent from the fresh earth 
                    that still clung to the carpet. Eliminate the stink that appeared 
                    to be putrefaction. He took a breather and watched the sun 
                    rise over the bay and questioned what it was that he was about 
                    to do.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222"> 
                    What sense did this make? </font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222"> 
                    It all led back to the cook.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222"> 
                    Lou, Sandy and Gabe were crossing the equator at the helm 
                    of the USS Hornet at the exact moment when the normally quiet 
                    and unassuming cook spoke up. They were all on deck, waiting 
                    for the word that they had crossed the equator, its boundary 
                    line to have some marker of distinction. It was V-Day.</font></p>
                  <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222">&quot;When 
                    all the flesh is gone, it's only the bones that are left to 
                    treasure,&quot; the cook spoke.</font></p>
                  <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222">&quot;Good 
                    God, man, where has your mind gone to? Hitting too much of 
                    the dishwashing liquid?&quot; Lou was incredulous at the comment 
                    from the cook Brandon, but softened in seeing the lack of 
                    effect on this man, who stood on the deck with them. Brandon 
                    just continued staring into the reflection of late afternoon 
                    sun on the heaving ocean.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222"> 
                    We all looked at him differently from that moment onward, 
                    Gabe recalled. Brandon had been an officer on the carrier 
                    through the war, but he suddenly went crazy in the past two 
                    months of deep ocean crossing, but not dangerously enough 
                    to send him to the brig. So they demoted him to a cook. Reason 
                    given was that he was a better cook than officer.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222"> 
                    There had been a burial at sea a few days earlier - the last 
                    fatality in World War II - and his death was mysterious. &quot;Jared 
                    died in his sleep&quot; was the official word.</font></p>
                  <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222">&quot;Such 
                    artificial dividing lines man has created. What did you expect 
                    crossing over the equator? The world to change?&quot;</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222"> 
                    Lou sunk it in, as was his bullying mode: &quot;Like when 
                    your buddy was dumped into the ocean.&quot;</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222"> 
                    They couldn't help but snicker.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222"> 
                    Brandon was unaffected, stating flatly, &quot;Now I see him 
                    all the time&quot;.</font></p>
                  <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222">&quot;Yea, 
                    you two must've been close, it appeared, since you brawled 
                    like a baby at his funeral,&quot; Sandy breathlessly tried 
                    to keep up with Lou biting sarcasm.</font></p>
                  <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222">&quot;These 
                    boundaries are so fake, just like the droppings left to figure 
                    out where we are.&quot;</font></p>
                  <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222">&quot;Equator 
                    my ass, nothing is different, what the hell did we expect,&quot; 
                    Lou spat out.</font></p>
                  <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222">&quot;I 
                    miss him every minute, you know, but there are ways to keep 
                    hold.&quot;</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222"> 
                    Well, grief has brought him to a very strange place, Gabe 
                    thought, and felt an extreme sudden disorientation at the 
                    edge of the carrier.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222"> 
                    Gabe always counted on the carrier's solid feel, bolts meshed 
                    immovably into steel. But now the welding seemed to become 
                    jelly, and he felt at the &quot;mercy&quot; of the ocean sway.</font></p>
                  <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222">&quot;Boundaries 
                    are not crossed lightly, you know,&quot; Brandon said, flinging 
                    the stub of a cigarette into the dark ocean. He spoke with 
                    an odd inflection, measuring every word, as if a scholar.</font></p>
                  <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222">&quot;But 
                    once a loved one dies, they can be kept back if you want.&quot;</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222"> 
                    Lou had to chuckle at that one, and exclaim, &quot;What kind 
                    of creepiness is this? It's lunacy. I hope that what your 
                    are taking doesn't get mixed in with our food.&quot;</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222"> 
                    The cook turned to Lou and said with an evenness that contrasted 
                    to his crazy implications. &quot;This will come in handy for 
                    you one day.&quot;</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222"> 
                    The he saw Gabe looking at his wedding day photo and asked 
                    how he would feel when Ana passed on. Gabe told him that he 
                    wanted to die before her, or best at the same time.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222"> 
                    The reflected sunset took the cook's features from the pale 
                    color of his skin to a darkening shade, finally to barely 
                    visible features in the dusk.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222"> 
                    He suddenly got all choked up.</font></p>
                  <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222">&quot;When 
                    you love someone for such a long time, you want them to stay 
                    with you so you can go together.&quot;</font></p>
                  <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222">&quot;For 
                    most people a photo album would just be fine, I'd think,&quot; 
                    wiseass Lou spoke first.</font></p>
                  <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222">&quot;No, 
                    no,&quot; Brandon insisted, starting hard at Gabe. &quot;Especially 
                    if they are your only source of happiness and the hedge against 
                    you succumbing to the worst parts of yourself. Because they 
                    will come after you to steal them away.&quot;</font></p>
                  <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222">&quot;After 
                    death?&quot; Sandy croaked.</font></p>
                  <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="222222">&quot;Yes, 
                    they come, and they try to tear them away. Bad enough they 
                    are already dead, but they want to take all traces of them 
                    from your soul. So you must ward them off the only way I know 
                    how. Bones scraping against bone, the sound that they detest.&quot;</font></p>
