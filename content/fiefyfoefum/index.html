        </font></i></font><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Fie, Fy, 
        Foe, Fum is a novel centering on the 225th anniversary of American independence 
        on July 4, 2001. In the following segment Lord Whitworth has drifted into 
        a disquieting sleep filled with nightmares about the Americanization of 
        Britain.</font></i> </p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
        The image that greeted Whitworth as he was shocked back to reality afforded 
        him no less anxiety than the dream from which he had escaped. The red, 
        white and blue pattern of the 225th Anniversary Celebration button that 
        slowly came into focus before him was abruptly replaced by the cherubic 
        though concerned face of Sir Lionel Rose-Crofton. Upon seeing Whitworth 
        stir, Sir Lionel brightened considerably. &quot;Alfred!&quot; he exclaimed 
        without thinking, and then leaned toward the side on which Whitworth wore 
        his hearing aide. &quot;<i>Alfred</i>,&quot; he cried even louder, emphasizing 
        each word, &quot;<i>how are</i> <i>you</i>?&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Whitworth staggered in response 
        to the volume and enthusiasm of Sir Lionel's greeting.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Oh, I am sorry, my dear 
        fellow.&quot; Sir Lionel sensed the reason for Lord Whitworth's reaction. 
        &quot;One never knows whether you're plugged in or not.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Whitworth regained his composure. 
        &quot;The state of my hearing is of no interest to anyone but myself and 
        the National Health.&quot; &quot;But you, sir, are another matter. You, 
        sir, and <i> your...behavior</i>.&quot; Whitworth rose from his chair. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Oh, dear,&quot; Sir Lionel 
        responded meekly, &quot;Have I been all that outrageous?&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Whitworth studied his companion 
        as a schoolmaster his most disobedient pupil. &quot;Rose-Crofton, I think 
        it's time we had a chat.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;By all means, old chap. 
        By all means.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Man-to-man,&quot; qualified 
        Whitworth .</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Oh my,&quot; Sir Lionel 
        said, intrigued by his own interpretation of Whitworth's tone, &quot;sounds 
        absolutely erotic.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Whitworth was unamused. &quot;For 
        God's sake, man, do take your mind out of the gutter.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Embarrassed by the reprimand, 
        Sir Lionel followed Whitworth to a more isolated corner of the sitting 
        room.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Just how long do you 
        intend to continue this habit of bringing <i> foreigners</i> to the Royal 
        Derby?&quot; demanded Whitworth with a bluntness that caught Sir Lionel 
        by surprise.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Foreigners? I'm afraid 
        I don't quite follow.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;That Yank,&quot; pressed 
        Whitworth. &quot;What about that Yank?&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Yank? Oh, you mean Walter 
        Teasdale! Lovely chap. I must introduce you sometime. He's with the...Oh 
        dear, I never can get it right...&quot; Sir Lionel hesitated, searching 
        his memory. &quot;...The Association--yes, that's it--Association of American 
        Newspaper Publishers...or something. Very influential group. We were going 
        over the itinerary for my trip to the States.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Whitworth, shocked by the 
        revelation, lowered himself into the nearest chair. Sir Lionel followed 
        his lead.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;They're having me over 
        to observe these 225th Anniversary festivities of theirs. And look here,&quot; 
        he said, directing Whitworth's attention to his souvenir pin, &quot;the 
        official celebration emblem. Isn't it charming?&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;<i>Charming</i>,&quot; 
        Whitworth responded sourly.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;I expect I'll be sending 
        back at least one column a week. And then, most likely, one big story 
        on the Princes' visit. It's all terribly exciting, of course. I mean being 
        in the field again. You know, Alfred, it's one thing to publish a daily, 
        but quite another to really get out the news.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;News!&quot; Whitworth 
        exploded with indignation. &quot;You call <i> this</i> news?!&quot; He 
        thrust <i> The Citadel</i> under Sir Lionel's nose. &quot;Now <i> really</i> 
        Rose-Crofton! Just how many front-page stories do you intend to run about 
        that...<i>birthday party</i>? And in red, white and blue yet! <i>Really</i>!&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Yes, it is striking,&quot; 
        Sir Lionel said naively, Whitworth's intended criticism having escaped 
        him. &quot;That was my idea, you know. My editor adored it! You know they're 
        using colour all the time in the States. Even the New York Times has been 
        doing it for some years now. Mind you if it's not the most important advance 
        since movable type...&quot; Sir Lionel leaned back in his chair with an 
        air of tranquility. &quot;My, but it will be lovely being a reporter again...<i>lovely</i>.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Whitworth jumped to his feet, 
        pulling loose the arm of the chair onto which he had gripped with increasing 
        anger as Sir Lionel spoke. &quot;<i>Striking</i>..bah! Why the nation 
        itself has existed for only two hundred and twenty-five years! Where's 
        their tradition, man? And for history--why they've barely a past to celebrate!&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Oh come now, Alfred,&quot; 
        admonished Sir Lionel. &quot;That's just plain silly. What about Bunker 
        Hill, the Continental Congress, Lexington and Concord? What about George 
        Washington, Nathan Hale, Madison, Franklin, Thomas Jefferson?&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Anarchists!&quot; Whitworth 
        snapped. &quot;The whole lot of them. Look here.&quot; He approached one 
        of the busts on display about the sitting room. &quot;My great, great, 
        great grandfather, the <i> first</i> Earl of Gloucester. An advisor to 
        the Crown!&nbsp;A founder of this very club! Why he spent years trying 
        to civilize the colonies. And how was he repaid? With the humiliation 
        of having to stand by helplessly while those ruffians poured cases of 
        good English tea into bloody Boston Harbor! Confound it man, if it's history 
        you want, just look around you.&quot; Whitworth motioned toward the momentos 
        that lined the walls. &quot;There's your tradition! Wellington, Kitchener, 
        Haig, Marlborough! Over nine hundred years of history and leadership. 
        Why not spread <i> that</i> across your blasted front page? Instead of 
        America, America, America, why not print something that shouts <i> This 
        is England</i>!&quot; </font></p>
