                    the three-toed sloth, rarely comes down from its tree. With 
                    its disproportionately long limbs, a sloth on the ground cannot 
                    even support its own body weight, and this predicament reduces 
                    the creature to an embarrassing, spread-eagled grope. Safely 
                    aloft, however, the sloth maintains its lifestyle of nineteen 
                    hours asleep followed by five hours of mild activity, the 
                    highlights of which include twig-eating and prolonged gazing. 
                    The sloth lives its ten-year lifespan in this way, high in 
                    the crooks of trumpet trees. It does not hunt or utter a single 
                    sound. It is non-territorial and cannot fight. Eventually, 
                    we must ask: what is the sloth <em>for</em>?<font size="+1">

                    no surprise if you can&#8217;t picture the face of a sloth. 
                    Its closest relative is the armadillo, but what help is that? 
                    The sloth has no first cousin and is solitary by nature. It 
                    is an evolutionary orphan. But before we find ourselves weeping 
                    in sympathy, notice the greenish hue of the sloth&#8217;s 
                    unusually long, coarse coat. Its fur was made with a certain 
                    aptitude for attracting algae, and there it grows, especially 
                    during rainy seasons. Along with this primeval colony, the 
                    sloth&#8217;s coat harbors moths and beetles that live off 
                    the algae. The sloth is even known to lick its own fur to 
                    get a taste of it, perhaps at those times when pulling a leaf 
                    is too much bother. And so, if we take the time, we see the 
                    sloth is not alone at all.</font></td>

                    is endowed with three hollow claws on the ends of each of 
                    its limbs. By hooking securely around slim branches, the curved 
                    claws allow the sloth to hang comfortably in its natural position: 
                    upside down. If you happen to see a sloth hanging this way, 
                    you might notice an unusual fact. While the coats of other 
                    longhaired animals fall down their sides from a sort of middle 
                    part along the spine, the sloth enjoys a part on its belly, 
                    with its long hair hanging with gravity toward its back. The 
                    sloth is so well adapted to this position in the world that 
                    it even gives birth and sleeps while firmly attached by its 
                    claws, like a living hammock. Sometimes the creature even 
                    remains suspended in its tree for a day or two after it dies.</font></td>

                    canopy because, to its sensibility, the earth is distracting, 
                    if not irrelevant? Perhaps the sloth is a deft navigator of 
                    its own subconscious and, if it ever decided to speak, would 
                    answer our questions in a soft somniloquy.</font></td>

                    taxidermist had spoken with Barnum only twice since he had 
                    arrived six months earlier. In one of the conversations, Barnum 
                    praised the museum&#8217;s taxonomic displays and assured 
                    Guillaudeu that his services were invaluable to any natural 
                    history enterprise. But Barnum then proceeded to reinvent 
                    the museum. The original red brick fa&ccedil;ade turned into 
                    a white, five-story advertisement, with a great transparency 
                    bearing an image of the mermaid, bare-breasted and smiling, 
                    billowing like the sail of a gaff-rigged schooner. Barnum 
                    had also opened the balcony that wrapped around the second 
                    floor, so that visitors now looked down at Broadway with the 
                    same curiosity that they gave the exhibits. </font></td>

                    office was located across from the ticket booth just inside

                    hero, the French anatomist Baron Georges Cuvier, had just 
                    written a discourse titled &#8216;On the Revolutionary Upheavals 
                    on the Surface of the Globe&#8217;, which the journal had 
                    excerpted. Long periods of inactivity reigned on the surfaces 
                    of the earth, said Cuvier, during which whole kingdoms of 
                    plants and animals flourished. These epochs, though, ended 
                    in cataclysms, usually of fire or flood. Out of the rubble 
                    of the old age would arise an entirely new set of creatures, 
                    which crawled and flew across the globe until the next apocalypse 
                    consumed them. As he read, Guillaudeu had the uncomfortable 
                    sense that a natural catastrophe had overcome the museum collection 
                    in the form of PT Barnum.</font></td>
