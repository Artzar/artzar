    <td><p align="center"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
        the stillness, in the beginning I imagine the whole world is holding it&#8217;s 
        breath, tight and desperate like an over stuffed balloon. The clouds, 
        grass and dirt stretched thin and painful below my feet, until they rupture, 
        sending us blind and helpless across the broken sky. Around me the birds 
        and polished insects swinging frantically from flower to bush to tree 
        have vanished, leaving the world hollow and silent. The wind rises, pushing 
        through the trees, twisting and bullying them. They arch painfully and 
        some to escape crack in long dull aches. The rain begins. Single drops 
        falling lightly on the grass, the porch, slapping flat and dull on the 
        metal body of the car. I close my eyes and raise my face, happy as it 
        washes away the grime and sullenness of the five-day heat. </font></p>
      <p align="center"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
        hear my mother call us inside, her voice sounding pinched and crooked 
        as her nerves grab up and close round her throat. The sound of it takes 
        away the joy of the rain, so I pretend I don&#8217;t hear her. Pretend 
        the wind and rain and soft growl of thunder in the distance have snatched 
        it, shoving it back inside the house with her vacuum and dirty laundry, 
        letting me linger longer under the black sky with my brother and sisters. 
        She calls to us again and I turn and see her thin body pressed close to 
        the screen door, her arms squeezed tight around her like killing vines. 
        Her eyes counting out the five of us. They make me want to shrink. Make 
        me want to deflate myself, turn myself into something soft and benign, 
        something she could hold in the palm of her hand or put into her breast 
        pocket, so she would only have to look to see that it was there. </font></p>
      <p align="center"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">No 
        words pass between us as we walk back toward the house. The desperate, 
        familiar notes of her voice have slid out the windows and down our throats, 
        cutting out our smart ass tongues that had flown so carelessly across 
        the lawn a few minutes earlier. The screen door snaps shut behind us and 
        the sound of it makes her jump. She grasps the closest one, my brother, 
        and back hands him. Pressing her nails into his flesh she shakes him, 
        screaming wildly, &#8220;YOU COME WHEN I CALL YOU! YOU COME WHEN I CALL 
        YOU!&#8221; The scar that curves up the side of her arm smiles at me, 
        smiles like a wet lip. The scar my father whispers about, his eyes shinning 
        with death and gossip. The scar my mother got as a girl reaching for her 
        brother as he drown. Her arm tearing on a metal drainage pipe until he 
        was still, floating half submerged like an old coat and she stood there 
        alone in a world so suddenly quiet. The scar stretches and twists with 
        the muscles of her arm, like it wants to scream, but it can&#8217;t. It&#8217;s 
        been sewn up to stop anything from getting out. I&#8217;m afraid it&#8217;s 
        him, sewn up inside her, lonely and enraged, stomping and screaming in 
        her arms and legs wanting to be alive with us. Wanting to pull our mother 
        under his dark water with him.</font></p>
      <p align="center"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> She 
        stops screaming and I open my eyes. The scar is limp and still. A ribbon 
        of blood traces from my brothers nose into the corner of his mouth like 
        he&#8217;s leaking. The amazement in his brown eyes makes her start to 
        cry and she stands in front of him making the low pitiful sounds an animal 
        makes when it&#8217;s been hit by a car. The kind of noise that freezes 
        your heart and makes you want to plug up your ears and hum so the vibrations 
        cover everything. She reaches for him and holds him close like he&#8217;s 
        a baby again, pressing his bloody face onto her breasts. &#8220;We&#8217;re 
        sorry mommy,&#8221; one of my sisters offers, whispering lightly, as if 
        the beauty and softness of her voice will stop her sound. The rest of 
        us repeat her line, murmuring gently, spreading the blame out among us. 
        </font></p>
      <p align="center"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">She 
        lets him go and wipes the blood off his face with the edge of her shirt. 
        Our dogs sniff the stain and look up at her with soft bewildered eyes. 
        Behind her some of the rain has soaked through the ceiling and expands 
        toward us on the floor. The beams of the old house shudder and ache, exhausted 
        by the elements. They could splinter, cave in on us no, one would know. 
        We are alone, rural, absent from the comings and goings of other people. 
        She gets a pot from the kitchen and places it under the leak. Then she 
        tells us to go to the car. I remember my father vaguely irritated, trying 
        to dismiss her fears of thunderstorms, flying; &#8220;The pilot doesn&#8217;t 
        want to crash either baby.&#8221; Impatient to have to hypothesize on 
        the unlikely, the irrelevant, the irrational, &#8220;It&#8217;s a million 
        to one.&#8221; He could be anywhere right now telling a stranger there 
        was nothing to worry about. </font></p>
      <p align="center"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We 
        run to the car and lock the doors. She drives slowly down the dirt driveway, 
        straining her head forward at the end, searching for cars or trucks barreling 
        toward us, invisible in the rain. Tears well in her eyes as we drive close 
        to the swollen banks of the Messelonske, it&#8217;s foul water churning 
        with whitecaps. I know where she&#8217;s going. Anticipate the corners 
        she turns, the colors and materials of the familiar houses, the rough 
        scraping the underbelly of the car makes as she pulls into the driveway, 
        stopping under the shadow of her childhood home. I&#8217;ve been here 
        before. We sit silently in the car, the air growing sour with the smell 
        of our humid bodies. I stare at the back of her head, trace my eyes over 
        the dark waves of her hair and the curve of her neck, trying to understand 
        her; trying to discern the quality and mood of her eyes as they travel 
        over the wasted house, looking back into the past that scars the flesh 
        of her arm.</font></p>
      <p align="center"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Outside 
        a fire engine passes, the red lights distorted through the cloudy windows. 
        The screaming sirens overwhelm the quiet within for a moment before fading 
        down an unseen street. The storm passes, slowly as storms do, leaving 
        the streets cleansed and shaken. Trees and parked cars glisten sharply 
        under the fluorescent streetlights. A man shouts in the distance and a 
        door snaps shut. Windows open and the canned laughter of TV cuts into 
        the stillness as the world tentatively comes to life again. My mother 
        starts the engine without a word and backs slowly onto the street. She 
        looks into the rearview mirror for a moment, at the dark windows of the 
        house like she&#8217;s searching one last time for something she&#8217;s 
        lost. I want to whisper to her, to calm those dark, haunted eyes. We can&#8217;t 
        be saved mom&#8230;we can&#8217;t be saved any of us. </font></p></td>
