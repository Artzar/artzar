        have humans come to be the way they are? What has our journey been like? 
        Anthropology is concerned with these questions. Anthropologists use the 
        fossil record and inductive reasoning to try to understand the conditions 
        in which our species came to be in the state that we see it today. One 
        person with unique insight into the evolutionary process is Dr. Ian Tattersall, 
        55, Head of the Anthropology Department as well as curator of the Hall 
        of Human Biology and Evolution at the American Museum of Natural History 
        in New York City. Dr. Tattersall is the author of numerous books and articles 
        on human evolution as well as an authority on lemurs. Exhibits in the 
        Hall include a 3 million year old skeleton named "Lucy" along with an 
        evocative diorama whose construction was supervised by Dr. Tattersall, 
        examples of the first human implements and architecture, and a replica 
        of the 30,000 year old cave paintings of Lascaux, France. I interviewed 
        Ian Tattersall in his office at the museum on November 6, 2000. </i></font>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>SHEDD: What does 
        anthropology have to offer society?</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> TATTERSALL: Basically, 
        the potential to answer a lot of curiosities. Human beings are very curious 
        people. They want answers. In one area of human experience, anthropology 
        has a unique perspective on those answers.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>Are we still evolving?</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> No. We don't have 
        the right conditions for any meaningful biological evolution of the species.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>What kind of 
        conditions would need to exist?</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> In order to get 
        the fixation of evolutionary novelties and new things in populations, 
        you need to have small isolated populations. Large, interbreeding populations 
        are just not the right place for innovations to become fixed. As our species 
        today is expanding, the population is becoming denser all the time; individual 
        mobility is becoming greater, and so those conditions of the isolation 
        of small fragmented populations just aren't there. You could imagine a 
        scenario where they might be reestablished, but if things remain the same, 
        essentially, no evolution.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>How important 
        is meat eating to our evolution?</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> It is very important 
        to our diets. To our evolution, it is probably very important as well. 
        Hunting came in at some point in human evolution and made a major revolution 
        in lifestyles. We don't even know exactly when that was, but whenever 
        it was, it certainly made a large difference.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>Why is the human 
        brain so large?</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> We have no idea 
        exactly why humans have gotten the large brains they have today. It is 
        clearly something in the human lineage that has predisposed humans to 
        larger brain size, but we don't even know what the exact pattern was. 
        All we can say is that 2 million years ago, average brain sizes among 
        hominids were not much bigger than they are among apes today. 2 million 
        years down the line, we have a brain that is 3 times that size. We don't 
        know what happened in-between. We don't know enough about the number of 
        species that have existed among hominids over the last 2 million years. 
        We don't know enough about the time range of those species or the range 
        in brain sizes. All we have is this simple observation that 2 million 
        years ago our precursors had small brains and today we have large brains. 
        We don't know what happened in the middle and we can't make the assumption 
        that it was a linear transformation, linear gain in brain size. In fact, 
        it almost certainly wasn't.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>How important 
        was fire in our cultural evolution?</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> That is a difficult 
        question to answer. Because for start, there is some controversy whether 
        the first claimed indications of fire, about 1.4 million years ago, are 
        in fact instances of domesticated fire. Hearths, places that were specifically 
        constructed to burn and domesticate fires in, don't come in until about 
        400 thousand years ago. At that point, there is clearly a major change 
        in hominid lifestyles but, again, we don't know exactly what those major 
        changes could have been. Clearly fire is a major factor in human life.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>Why would speech 
        be so important in Cro-Magnon development?</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> The Cro-Magnon are 
        clearly symbolic entities. They are clearly forms that depended very much 
        on symbolic reasoning to conduct their lives. We have absolutely no evidence 
        among earlier hominids of symbolic reasoning. We know that the Cro-Magnon, 
        who are a European group, essentially, are relatively recent. They invaded 
        Europe about 40 thousand years ago and they came equipped with all these 
        modern behavioral abilities. On the other hand, in the Levant, we have 
        evidence of hominids who look just like us but behave just like Neanderthals 
        as much as 100 thousand years ago. There is not a one-to-one correspondence 
        with modern human anatomy and modern human behavior. You have to look 
        for something, some potential that underlies symbolic cognitive processes 
        but that had to be released in some way by some kind of cultural stimulation. 
        Frankly, language is the most likely candidate. In fact, most people can't 
        think of another one that might have released this potential and these 
        new behaviors.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>Were species 
        co-existing before the Neanderthals and the Cro-Magnon?</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Probably true. We 
        tend to think, since we are the only hominid in the world today, that 
        this is how it's always been. Clearly at one point we have evidence for 
        4 different species of hominids, around 2 million years ago on the same 
        landscape in northern Kenya, let alone what was going on in the world 
        as a whole.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>What kind of 
        people made the cave art in France and Spain?</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> The cave art is 
        part of this whole Cro-Magnon behavioral explosion. The creators of that 
        art were clearly modern people, not modern in a historical sense, but 
        people with modern behavioral abilities. I can't think of a better example 
        that you could put forward of the origin or the presence very early on 
        of modern behavioral symbolic activities. What the art meant is a different 
        question. It is to be experienced rather than explained.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>What is the human 
        capacity?</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> We are still discovering 
        what the human capacity is. The human capacity is everything that makes 
        us unique. And with every year that goes by we are exploring our capacities 
        in new ways. We don't know yet what the human capacity is.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>When did hominids 
        first display the human capacity?</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Basically the earliest 
        evidence we have is from the Cro-Magnon in Europe, but there is inferential 
        evidence from the very early occupation of Australia 60 thousand years 
        ago by people who must have been quit extraordinary navigators to get 
        there then. In Africa there are hints of symbolic behavior like making 
        of beads and trading objects long distances and so on in the 40-60 thousand 
        years ago range. There are these hints but the record isn't very good.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>Why is burial 
        of the dead so significant in human history?</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> It is something 
        that only humans do in the world today and it is the earliest such behavior 
        that we have found. Neanderthals probably invented burial of the dead 
        but their motivations for doing so may have been very different from the 
        kind of motivations that Homo sapiens have.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>What are the 
        impacts of the discovery of the Lucy skeleton?</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> It sort of inaugurated 
        the modern era of studies of very early hominids in Africa. It was the 
        only place where there are very early hominids. It was a catalyst that 
        sparked a lot of later work. You could probably date the modern era of 
        Paleoanthropology in Africa from that discovery.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>Is she really 
        named after the Beatles "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds"?</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> [laughs] I have 
        no idea. Don Johanson would claim that's what it was.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>Why bipedalism?</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> That is a very good 
        question. There has been a lot of argument about why bipedalism and in 
        fact that is maybe looking at it the wrong way. Did we stand up so we 
        could shed heat better or so we could locomote better on the Savannah? 
        Did we stand up so we could see further and detect predators better on 
        the horizon? Did we stand up so we could free our forelimbs? All these 
        things were probably involved. The fact is you have to stand up first 
        and once you are able to stand up and walk erect then you have all the 
        possibilities of this new posture available to you. And I don't really 
        think it is possible to sort or separate them out individually. We bought 
        a package. For whatever reason, those early hominids who stood upright 
        ultimately were more successful, certainly in moving away from the forests. 
        And that is what is important, the success of the species rather than 
        any particular proclivity that this made possible.</font></p>
      <p><img src="/content/tattersall/graphics/diorama.jpg" width="315" height="213"></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>Where did the 
        concept for the diorama come from?</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> We wanted to choose 
        one of the very few behavioral incidences for which we had evidence in 
        the fossil record. It is very rare that you can isolate a behavioral moment. 
        The reason why the diorama looks like it does is because it was the least 
        committal statement that we could make about the circumstances under which 
        it was made. You have got two individuals of different size, one with 
        big feet, one with small feet, walking together and in step. So those 
        two tracks must have been made at the same time by individuals walking 
        together, and they are very close together indeed. You know that it could 
        have been a large male and a juvenile or a whole number of different scenarios 
        that might account for the size differences between the two individuals. 
        We thought it would be visually most interesting to have a male and female, 
        so that is what we did. They are so close together that they must have 
        been braced together somehow. They must have been in some form of contact. 
        Maybe they were carrying something but we have no idea what it might have 
        been. They might have been holding hands. It seemed to us that any representation 
        that we made would be loaded with implications, so maybe the implications 
        of this particular scenario were the least.</font></p>
