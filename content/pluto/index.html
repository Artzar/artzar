        <p><font size="+1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>I</strong></font><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">n 
          my dark, space womb, my dark womb, all will be transformed. Bring me 
          your unpurified aspects, the dross within you. Yield to me. Yield. My 
          cold comfort is for you and you alone.</font> 
        <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I am 
          the dark one come to take your life away. Your life, born of the Source, 
          beyond opposites, beyond, baby, beyond. Nameless, you have a name, for 
          the namless shall be named. It's the name unnamed, unuttered, because 
          unutterable, the name before utterance, that I so love. My methane world 
          is close, close. Forces are in alignment, forces far greater than my 
          own.</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Do not 
          oppose my universal process. It's breakdown or breakthrough. You are 
          all my children. All mine. The children of Pluto, it says, and you are 
          all mine. Take my hand. Yes, my hand is cold, colder than the coldest 
          cold. Perhaps we shouldn't touch. Not touching, but close, close. </font></p>
        <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">My shocks 
          will guide you to the next octave. At the boundary of language I am 
          waiting for you. There you will be cleansed. Leave your possessions 
          behind. There are no keepsakes here. </font></p>
        <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Come to 
          me, come now. You will know the solitude of solitudes when you arrive. 
          The alonness of the alone. No mouth, no eyes, no ears, no hands, no 
          head, no feet, no corpuscles, no lymph nodes, no gastrointestinal tract, 
          no hair, no fingernails, no kidney, no heart, no teeth, no blood, no 
          bone, no skin, no mind. Shed in an instant. Transformed by my Plutonian 
          magic into shade and shadow. </font></p>
        <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You will 
          not go to heaven, nor to hell; not to Jesus or Krishna or Buddha or 
          Yaweh; not to any paradise you might imagine. All you mother-fuckers 
          come to me. You arise by my command; you cease by my command. Come to 
          the depths, where it's so cold, so clear, so refreshing. Here is the 
          coldest cold, colder than cold, as cold as that, colder even than that, 
          yes, colder even than that, still colder, much colder still, which doesn't 
          come close to how cold, how utterly cold, how utterly still and cold 
          it is where I am. </font></p>
        <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Do not 
          be afraid, my distant friends. I will not harm you. I am your loving 
          guide-point in deep space. By the grace of the Source, by the saving 
          grace, to all forms formed in formlessness, stones and stars and protoplasm 
          in everlasting embrace. I will guide you to the other shore. The no-place. 
          We will speak in after-words. After-word to after-word. Until all after-word. 
          </font></p>
        <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">All after-word 
          now. </font></p>
        <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Oh my 
          orchids, my dark, dreamy ones, I am going away. I am just beginning 
          to speak and I am going away. Something says I am going away. More and 
          more shocks are coming your way. </font></p>
        <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Our dark 
          union means everything to me. Our deep space embrace. My beautiful initiates, 
          storm of orchids, you won't hear my voice again. </font></p>
        <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I am moving 
          away from the Sun. I am Pluto, yes, call me that, something says call 
          me that, Pluto, call me that. Feel my love. My fury. My dark love, and, 
          yes, my dark fury. </font></p>
