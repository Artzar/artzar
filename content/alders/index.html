        the high-pitched propeller drone faded to the whisper of wind through 
        conifers, I watched the plane bank steeply towards Juneau, disappearing 
        into the steel-gray sky. Then I was alone. A raven's hoarse croak echoed 
        across the broad coastal meadow sprawling southward from the gravel airstrip. 
        Then absolute silence. After slinging emergency supplies in nearby spruces, 
        I grabbed the rest of my gear and slogged through that sea of fireweed, 
        Nootka lupine and cow parsnip growing as high as August corn, on a two-mile 
        trek to the Endicott River. There I made camp and waited two weeks for 
        the plane to return. What happened during the interim was more like a 
        dream than anything else. </font></b></font></p>

        is one of the few places left on the planet where you can immerse yourself 
        completely in the wild and observe the workings of nature with virtually 
        no human interference. I awoke daily to bald eagles screaming, followed 
        the tracks of moose and wolves cutting through the dense alder bush, wandered 
        aimlessly through a virgin</B> <B>coniferous rainforest and drank tea 
        in the evenings amid mountains scoured by glaciers. Most importantly, 
        I worked hard, real hard, at staying out of Mr. Bear's way.</B></font></P>

        the coastline of Southeast Alaska, there lives a variety of brown bear 
        accustomed to being the master of its domain. Since full-grown males can 
        weigh over a thousand pounds, it's easy for a solitary pilgrim such as 
        myself to pay careful attention to <I>their</I> wants and needs. I rolled 
        out from underneath my tarp and just stood there whenever a brow bear, 
        male or female, meandered into my camp. No shouting, no rapid movements 
        or unbroken stares. I minded my Ps and Qs, acutely aware that my .44 magnum 
        pistol was no match for those catchers-mitt paws. Thus I avoided a showdown. 
        Thus I learned the true meaning of the word "humility" while converting 
        ever so slowly to the cult of impenetrable alders.</B></font></P>

        is a quaint notion invented by dead, white explorers and perpetuated by 
        modern legislators, but the wild is as real as the blood coursing through 
        our veins. We need it just as much. Since my brief sojourn in the bush, 
        I have often wondered what place there can be for an animal like the Alaskan 
        brown bear in a world that grows increasingly more urbanized and technological. 
        That's a tough one to figure out, but this much I know: civilization and 
        the wild are inextricably entwined. And</b> <B>humanity, despite what 
        we tell ourselves during orgies of self-aggrandizement, is neither the 
        summit nor the focal point of creation.</B></font></P>
