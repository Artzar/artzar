              are acknowledging that to cling to your belief of what you are and
              what the world is is really an illusion. As long as we remain committed
              to wearing blinders, to looking the other way, to playing the game
              the way the dream of the planet suggests it should be played, that
              we're sitting in an island of safety that we've created and all
              around us is hell. And as long as we cling to the attachments of
              just plodding along with life as we think that we know it based
              on the belief systems that were mostly rammed down our throats by
              parents, religions, schools, peers, society, you name it, then we're
              in a little island that we've created in a sea of hell where very
              few people are really happy. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">So you acknowledge
              in the Citadel that the things that you're attached to are keeping
              you trapped and stuck and that these severe attachments are hindering
              your freedom. They might be self-esteem issues: not good enough,
              or wearing masks of self-importance, or attached to judging other
              people so I can feel superior to them, or feeling like I was a victim
              or wearing a mask that I was somebody special or maybe wearing a
              mask that I wasn't any good. These are all feelings but these feelings
              are alive. The work can be very painful.&quot;</font></p>
