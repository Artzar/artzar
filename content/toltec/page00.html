            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" >How do you
              translate a feeling of the spirit onto celluloid? This was the task
              photographer Stephen Collector set out for himself during intensive
              guided retreats in October 1998 and May 1999 to the Temple Complex
              at <a href="teotituacan.html">Teotituac&aacute;n</a> (Nahuatl: &quot;The
              City of the Gods&quot;). Collector used infrared film which is sensitive
              to heat. He thought this was the proper medium to convey the <i>feeling</i>
              of the place. His work has appeared in the likes of The New York
              Times, Esquire, German Geo and Outside.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" >
              I spoke with Stephen Collector, 49, by phone in Boulder, Colorado
              where he lives with his wife and two sons. He told me about a long
              period of soul searching whereupon he came face to face with a "wounded
              mind." His own. In a search for healing he came upon a Toltec Shaman.</font></p>
            <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" >"In ancient
              times," Collector says,"Teotituac&aacute;n was actually a university.
              It functioned as a center for the entire continent for learning
              about energy. My guide told me that Teo was still energetically
              available to any human being that could try to experience the place
              not from his mind, his intellect, or his reason but from his heart.
              And that was the key to unlock the mystery of the place." </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" >He was part
              of a group that worked through the hierarchical complex in a very
              structured way over a five-day period. Originally, he told me, you
              stayed in these compounds in groups, which are particular "classrooms,"
              for years, until you mastered that limitation and could move on.
              The whole group needed to make the transformation. You couldn't
              move on as individuals. And a lot of people never made it to the
              final, 7th, level because there wasn't any faking of the transformation.
              </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" >"Of
              course," he says, "we were working on an abbreviated level because
              this place is like a State Park, administered by the federal government.
              You had to be discrete about performing ceremonies." </font></p>

              said that the first couple of days were excruciatingly painful because
              the work is about taking your masks off, going into your shadows
              and working with fear. And if the guides thought you had the wherewithal
              to stand it, "they'd push you as deeply into fear as they possibly
              could, into the stuff that you just don't want to look at in your
              life. Things you haven't looked at since you were a kid, where a
              lot of your processes and definitions and beliefs were actually
              formulated." </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" >He
              said that by the third day things started to change. "And by the
              fourth and fifth day your awareness is in a completely different
              place. It's miraculous... The key, according to my teachers, is
              that there is information in light. That light isn't what you think
              it is. Light is alive. There's life in light. And that's what we
              are as human beings. You do the cleaning and get out of your own
              way. The cornerstone of the teaching is love, unconditional love.
              That's what you're attaining. It has nothing to do with the Aztec's
              ripping people's hearts out, even though they did do that. It's
              about opening your heart, metaphorically, not with an obsidian knife.
              Obviously some of them abused the power."</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" > To be inside
              and outside of a transformative process such as this is walking
              a tightrope. I'm reminded of William Burroughs attending a Buddhist
              retreat of several days and agreeing to leave paper and pen behind
              so he might fully experience the process and not "record" it. As
              it turned out, Burroughs snuck in a notebook and pencil and recorded
              some remarkable dreams. He couldn't help himself. And neither could
