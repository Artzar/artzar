      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In writing about the work of 
        John Gurche I must admit a bias right off the bat. I've known him since 
        we walked together as school kids along creek beds in Kansas. I was just 
        along for the company but John was already hard at work gathering skeletons 
        of any creatures he could find to take back to his basement laboratory 
        for study. Even then his course was set. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the field of paleo-art, 
        John Gurche's work, in both painting and reconstruction, rests at the 
        pinnacle. His work resides in the American Museum of Natural History in 
        New York, The Field Museum in Chicago, the Smithsonian Institution in 
        Washington, DC, and the Denver Museum of Nature and Science. You have 
        seen it on the covers of <i>National Geographic</i>, <i>Natural History</i>, 
        <i>Smithsonian</i> and <i>Discover</i> as well as in books such as The 
        Rise of Life, by John Reader (Knopf, 1986). You may even have held it 
        in your hand and sent it to a loved one or bill collector as he was the 
        artist of the U.S. Postal Service dinosaurs issued in 1989.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Gurche, 50, lives in Denver 
        with his wife and three children. I spoke with him on February 25th, 2001 
        at the house of a mutual friend in Kansas City where a reunion was taking 
        place of the rock band we played in back in the early 70's. One little 
        known fact about Gurche: he's also a hell of a drummer.</font></p>

    <td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">They only had a nebulous idea 
      of what they wanted, which was great. I really wanted a painting that represented 
      the evolution of life from about 700 million to present, using groups that 
      were important at different times in earth's history. So the fact that it 
      was wide open and they didn't know what they wanted was a great thing to 
      me because I could really start kind of dreaming it up and putting down 
      on paper the various sections of the thing and how they relate to each other 
      and just really be free with that. I knew enough paleontology to begin to 
      get the initial designs right away. I was obsessed with the Tower of Time. 
      I'd be riding the subway drawing little sections of it on the back of an 
      envelope. It was a very happy time. </font></td>

    <td valign="top"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When I'm asked 
      to do a reconstruction the first thing I have to do is work with the skull. 
      The first part of it involves reconstructing the skull, and if there's any 
      distortion, correcting that. Maybe casting and molding it and bending it 
      so the distortion is corrected. That sort of thing. I consult with anthropologists 
      during that phase of it. And then it goes into this thing where I've done 
      this really intensive body of work dissecting Great apes and humans and 
      what I'm looking for is relationships between the bony tissue and the soft 
      tissue of the face and head. I'm looking for rules that are so robust that 
      they apply not only to humans but also to African apes. African ape faces 
      and human faces are very different. You might think there would be very 
      much in common there but it's not really true. There are a number of rules 
      that apply to both, as far as the relationship between bony anatomy and 
      soft tissue. Then it's not too big of a leap if you find something that 
      holds for gorillas and Pygmy chimps and humans. It's not too big a leap 
      to use those for human ancestors as well. So my methodology developed out 
      of all that dissection work and finding some predictive value in the bones 
      themselves. You look at modern skeletons and it tells you how to read a 
      skeleton in terms of what soft tissue is connected to it.</font></td>

      takes about 5 months. About 3 and a half of that are the slow building of 
      tissue up from the skull, muscle by muscle, gland by gland. The last bit 
      is casting it in a flesh-like substance, implanting hairs and all those 
      realistic touches that bring it to life.</font></td>

      as something that's real and alive to people then there's not really much

      to connect with our past, and there's no better way of doing that then to 
      be able to look into a face and see that individual as alive.</font></td>

    <td valign="top"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I did get to study 
      the body but only after the fact because the Austrians who had it at the 
      time we're keeping it very close to the vest. They weren't letting in anybody 
      to study it or even photograph it. The National Geographic photographer 
      apparently got about 30 seconds. He was ushered into a room, took a few 
      shots, then ushered out. They published about the skull in particular, measurements 
      and also CAT scan images from a great number of angles. I had all that material 
      and used it to generate a skull that was identical to the one that they 
      had imaged inside the body. I didn't actually see the body until after the 
      whole thing was finished. I went over there to see if everything I had done, 
      and everything that I thought I was seeing&#150;little hints in the soft 
      tissue from photographs&#150;I wanted to see if I got that part right. I 
      planned a trip over there but at the last minute National Geographic pulled 
      the funding because they didn't think that I was going to get in so I just 
      went ahead anyway and I did get in. The build-up to seeing the Ice Man's 
      body was really tremendous. I was told by virtually everybody that there 
      was no way I'd get in, including the right-hand guy of the main man who 
      makes the decision. I went out with him for a drink the night before and 
      he said, &quot;No. There's no way.&quot; But I gave them a slide show of 
      the work I'd done for National Geographic and the reconstruction and gave 
      them a point-by-point anatomical description of what <i>that</i> was all 
      about. And they could see I was serious about it. Then the guy who was controlling 
      things decided to let me in. So there I was in a waiting room full of German-speaking 
      scientists. They were having a conversation which I didn't understand, except 
      for the words <i>scrotum</i> and <i>penis</i> &#133;blah blah blah blah 
      scrotum, blah blah blah blah penis. As it turned out, although they'd published 
      that the penis and scrotum were missing, suddenly they had found them. The 
      translation I read later was that the genitals were there all of the time 
      but they were just very&#133;very&#133; flat. [laughs] So there we all were 
      when suddenly we got the ok and we all went downstairs and got suited up 
      in surgical garb. The build-up was just so tremendous that I started feeling 
      really light-headed and physically weird. And I thought, Oh, this is great, 
      I'm gonna walk in, faint and fall into the Iceman's arms. But luckily that 
      didn't happen.</font></td>

        was your involvement in Jurassic Park?</font></b></p></td>
    <td valign="top"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Amblin productions 
      called me in the summer of 1990 to work on the pre-production for Jurassic 
      Park. When they said it was Amblin calling they were kind of expecting a 
      gasp or some surprised reaction from me but I didn't know who Amblin was. 
      Oh, it's Steven Spielberg's movie company, they said. They wanted me to 
      first work on the Tyrannosaurus, so I did anatomy and accurate reconstructions 
      of the critter. Then they asked me to work on the Velociraptor segment. 
      And they wanted to talk about everything from plot segments that might be 
      done with bringing a dinosaur into the twentieth century, to the visual 
      aspects&#133;almost the <i>character</i> of the dinosaur. I've always viewed 
      Velociraptor as probably the scariest and creepiest dinosaur. So a lot of 
      them were night scenes about Velociraptors trying to get into the Visitor 
      Center or being in the library with one of them right on the next row, you 
      can hear it moving around but you can't really see where it is. I did a 
      lot of drawings like that and had a great time. I came up with some plot 
      segments which were in the script for a while but later got canned. And 
      I was unwittingly responsible for maybe the least scientific detail of the 
      anatomy, which was the neck frills on the Daspletosaurus, the spitters. 
      The art director called me one day and wanted to talk about plot segments. 
      He said, I want something where the paleontologist, by his special knowledge, 
      gets them out of a jam. So I said, OK, let' see, maybe when they're taking 
      the tour initially, before everything goes wrong, they see two male dinosaurs 
      of some species facing off, having an aggressive encounter, and one of them 
      has an inflatable portion of its anatomy, like birds and frogs, and it blows 
      this thing up and it scares off the other male, and then later in the movie 
      you see the humans get trapped by that same kind of dinosaur, it's backed 
      them into a corner or something, and then suddenly the paleontologist looks 
      over and sees this umbrella that's the same color&#150;let's say black and 
      red stripes&#150;makes the connection, picks up the umbrella, unfolds it 
      and makes it run off. That got incorporated as part of the plot but then 
      they took it out and only left the anatomy in.</font></td>
