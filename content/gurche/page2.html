      from that and they're just awful. Every once and a while when I visit they 
      get them out and we just laugh. But I was drawing things that I wasn't inspired 
      about, like grapes [laughs]. I loved doing drawing and painting as a kid, 
      like most kids do, I just never stopped. I kept painting on the side while 
      I was studying anthropology and paleontology in grad school and was able 
      to combine them.</font> </td>

    <td valign="top"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The usual paintings 
      that most people have seen are pretty well planned from the beginning. I 
      try to base them on a moment of inspiration, working with a design that 
      I really like before I start the painting. But sometimes little serendipitous 
      things happen along the way. There's a painting that was in <i>National</i> 
      <i>Geographic</i>--I hadn't painted the head of the critter yet, it was 
      still a black silhouette, and I got it up to a certain point and it was 
      beautiful, it looked like an Alfred Hitchcock dinosaur because this one 
      animal's head was totally in shadow and blacked out. </font></td>

    <td valign="top"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That's kind of 
      wide open. When I worked on the reconstruction painting of &quot;Sue&quot; 
      that's now hanging next to the skeleton at the Field Museum, the coloration 
      of the animal had already gone through a formal review process, which seemed 
      kind of funny because, obviously, we don't know what color they were. I 
      guess they didn't want it to be outlandish. All you can really say is that 
      modern relatives of dinosaurs have color vision and use it in their social 
      behavior, for display and so forth, so it's pretty reasonable to think that 
      dinosaurs did also.</font></td>

    <td valign="top"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He was the founding 
      father of the field. A lot of artists and paleontologists were effected 
      by his work. They saw his paintings when they were kids. I remember when 
      I was very young, staring at his painting of an Allosaurus standing over 
      a Saropod carcass. I stared and stared at it and thought it was a photograph. 
      I knew there was something wrong with having a photograph of dinosaurs and 
      tried to get my mom to explain it to me. But it did what I hope to do when 
      I paint a picture, which is to transport the viewer back in time and to 
      see it as not some Fairyland world, but as a real, living biological system.</font></td>

    <td valign="top" width="100"><p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What is it like seeing the 
        cave art in France?</font></b></p> </td>
    <td valign="top"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It was a very powerful 
      experience, not easy to describe. Caves are magical worlds anyway. They're 
      kind of a place of the &quot;Other&quot;, an alternative to the world to 
      what we generally see, of trees and sunshine. It's another world down there. 
      It makes sense to me that they were sometimes used as sanctuaries, holy 
      places, and maybe as places where shamans took their journeys to the Dream 
      Time or whatever &quot;other&quot; world they have. It's easy to think of 
      the caves as being able to offer a real place to do that. So going down 
      there and standing where they did and looking at these paintings, especially 
      when they're really good paintings, like Lascaux or Altimira is just a stunning 
      thing. It's so much wonder that you almost can't stand it. For about 4 years 
      I was a co-leader on a tour that went into those caves. We took all sorts 
      of rich folks there. Some of them seemed like really jaded people until 
      we got inside and they wept like babies.</font></td>

    <td valign="top" width="100"><p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Were you given much liberty 
        with the dinosaur stamps?</font></b></p> </td>
    <td valign="top"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Not too much. They 
      didn't have set scenes, but they'd picked out the animals. It's pretty restrictive 
      to what you can do on a stamp. It's not exactly a venue for self-expression 
      on a painting that's about an inch and a half wide [laughs]. Usually the 
      artist does it 5 times up but I was already neck-deep into another project 
      so I said I'd do it but only if I can do it 1.5 times up. So it was only 
      a little larger.</font></td>

        projects.</font></b></p> </td>
    <td valign="top"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I've always loved 
      the way certain Renaissance artists drew anatomy. It's sort of messy. It's 
      almost like they're illustrating a thought process. Very loose line drawings 
      of anatomy that Leonardo and Michaleangelo did. Though Michaelangelo burned 
      a lot of his. I've always loved the way they delt with anatomy. It's probably 
      the best style for capturing anatomical details. They have a powerful aesthetic 
      quality. So I wanted to start working in a similar way. It was hard at first 
      because I'm used to working so tightly. I had to get <i>real</i> loose before 
      I could begin. My first response is to draw a line and then say, Oh my god, 
      how am I going to make the second line parallel to the first line. But you 
      can't do it that way. You've got to be much looser or it won't work. The 
      first twenty times I tried it I couldn't do it. But then it started to work 
      out. This all came out of doing anatomical research for the paintings I've 
      done for <i>National Geographic</i> and other publications. Sometimes you 
      come upon anatomical forms that are aesthetically more powerful then the 
      paintings they're supposed to inform. So after a build-up of experiences 
      like that until I just had to start drawing. It's taking a time-out from 
      commissioned work to draw&#150;fossil skulls that I've worked with or gorilla 
      anatomy or whatever it is. They're mostly larger than the other work. They 
      start out as drawings but kind of take a left turn and rely heavily on accidents. 
      They almost never turn into what I had planned them to be. It's a very fun 
      process to be able to go with those left turns when they happen instead 
      of making them conform to a strict plan. It's called Lost Anatomies. </font></td>

      working at the nexus of science and art. </font></b></td>
    <td valign="top"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To me there's less 
      of a dichotomy than for some people. Their aims and methodologies are different. 
      But there's an awful lot of crossover in terms of the motivation for doing 
      both. I think a lot of scientists are aesthetically motivated but I don't 
      know how many of them would admit it. The scientific stuff and the aesthetic 
      stuff feed each other. I think an aesthetic feeling for the subject motivates 
      a lot of scientists and artists alike.</font></td>

  <tr> 
    <td valign="top" width="100"><p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Doesn't the art transcend the 
        science in that it makes &quot;something else&quot; happen?</font></b></p> </td>
    <td valign="top"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I think it's the 
      subject that makes the &quot;something else,&quot; I don't think it's the 
      art. To me it's that skull sitting on the table that's the center of it. 
      It's those things in their own right that can be so aesthetically powerful 
      that it just makes you have to draw it. And the big surprise to me is that 
      more paleontologists and anthropologists don't also want to be drawers and 
      painters. I don't know if I think of the artist as transcending something. 
      It's all coming from the thing itself. And the art is a way to capture it.</font></td>
