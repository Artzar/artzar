        morning at nine, punctual as a computer, I left the hotel. I ate a quick 
        breakfast standing up at a counter inside one of the cafes, and for the 
        next three hours wandered the labyrinthine streets behind the Piazza San 
        Marco. Hopelessly lost, in a pleasant daze, I followed one street after 
        another, turning on impulse, because my nostrils in the damp air suddenly 
        detected a different smell. Sometimes I found myself at a dead end. Sometimes 
        I came upon diminutive squares with prinkling fountains, doorways arched 
        with ornate designs, old women sweeping the entryways. Sometimes, by sheer 
        chance, I cam out on the piazza at the opposite end from where I had entered. 
        Sometimes I found myself hopelessly lost, a long distance from the piazza 
        and hotel, footsore and weary, with no way back other than the way I had 
        come, if I could remember it.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">After lunch I rested and read 
        a while. Every afternoon at four I was back in the piazza. A dull sun, 
        glimmering between rafts of gloomy clouds, shone bleakly upon the damp 
        stones. The few people sitting in the open-air cafes drank coffee or glasses 
        of pink aperitif.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">There was one event by which 
        I regulated my internal clock every day without fail. Precisely at four 
        o'clock, a little man in blue overalls emerged from a side entrance to 
        the Doge's Palace, dragging two red canisters toward the shady end of 
        the piazza, where he stood stiffly at attention till all the bells in 
        the nearby churches and campanile tolled the four o'clock hour. Then he 
        picked up one of the canisters and poured out a ribbon of tawny-colored 
        seed, tracing a wide pattern as he walked. Pigeons fluttered out of the 
        sky like ashy snowflakes. Tourists clutching cameras closed in on the 
        whirling birds. Somewhere in the middle of this feathery riot, I could 
        discern the red canister bobbing up and down. Pigeons stacked three and 
        four deep on the piazza crawled and shivered on each other's backs--jabbing, 
        tearing, plucking. Children frolicked about the fringes of the seething 
        mass, kicking at the birds, sending them clucking into the air. With the 
        canisters emptied, the little man strode briskly out of the storm, pigeons 
        clinging to his sleeves and shoulders like scraps of paper. Within a few 
        minutes that corner of the square was picked clean. The pigeons melted 
        back into the dreary sky, or settled along the eaves and balconies of 
        the ornate buildings. A few remained, scouring the cracks between the 
        flagstones.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">That winter, in Grosvenor 
        Square, riot police standing shoulder to shoulder behind a phalanx of 
        plastic shields hurled tear gas to break up our protest in front of the 
        ugly white monstrosity of the American Embassy. In Paris a few weeks later, 
        angry demonstrators surged through the streets, tipping over automobiles 
        and setting them ablaze. They tore up paving stones and chucked them through 
        plate-glass windows. They clashed with right-wing groups chanting &quot;Kill 
        the Vietcong!&quot; in violent battles that left dozens of people dazed 
        and bleeding. It was as if the world had taken its cue from those bold 
        monks who periodically torched themselves in the public squares of Saigon. 
        Martin Luther King's assassination was more than a month away, but you 
        could feel it in the air, the probability that anything could happen, 
        convulsions of apocalyptic proportions, another death by senseless fire. 
        How soothing it was to spend a while in Venice, adrift in a floating gallery 
        of finely wrought architecture, not seeing any cops, getting lost in the 
        streets, listening to the melodious lilt of the language, taking the <i>vaporetto</i> 
        out to Lido Beach, watching the scummy water of the interior canals rise 
        and fall with the tug of the moon.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">After the little man in blue 
        coveralls with the red canisters had departed from the piazza, I bought 
        several packets of seed. In a corner of the damp square, away from the 
        tables and chairs, I poured seed onto the brim of my Trilby hat and scattered 
        it across my shoulders and sleeves. The pigeons settled in feathery clusters 
        on every part of my body, clawing for purchase, pecking, snatching, gurgling 
        with feverish rapture. I extended my overflowing palms and giggled to 
        myself as they mewed and shivered the length of my arms. They settled 
        on my shoulders, pecked my neck and fingers, clawed my wrists and elbows, 
        tore at the loose threads curling off my tweed jacket. I was like a scarecrow, 
        straw-stuffed and frowzy, pocked with holes, sightless, tongueless, relishing 
        every bold stab, their shivery, insistent weight. The Venetians ignored 
        me. People come to Venice from all over the world for every conceivable 
        reason: What was this to them? For me, it was the best therapy I could 
        think of. A kind of feathery immolation...scaly feet, thorny beaks...Osiris 
        devoured by a rabble of tawdry birds.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">I slept better than I had 
        in months. Images of the Tet Offensive, stacks of American and Vietnamese 
        corpses, which the BBC aired every night and which I watched on the watery 
        black and white telly in my little flat in East Anglia, faded from my 
        consciousness. The world was lit with fire, each fire igniting a fresh 
        one, until, like a string of incendiary beads, they linked the hemispheres 
        in a crackling necklace. Che was dead, and so was a kid I'd gone to high 
        school with, killed by a shellburst at Da Nang. Venice floated like a 
        gaudy platter on the swell of a filthy tide. At night, half-drunk, prowling 
        the clammy flagstones, I could feel it tugging at the ropes, as if trying 
        to cut loose and sail out to sea like a sludgy old scow. The dull roar 
        of heavy bombers delivering their dreadful loads crashed through my ears. 
        It was like being from no country at all, or a place you no longer belonged 
        to. When people asked where I was from, I said &quot;Canada&quot; and 
        looked away at the gulls whirling in hungry flocks over the garbage-strewn 
        canals.</font></p>
