        audience of three and gauges reactions.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><strong><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></strong><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rape." 
        He looks past the gold sateen drapery and through the grime-encrusted 
        plate glass window atop this fifteen storied, air-conditioned and concrete-slab 
        constructed, internationally-financed co-op. And beyond, his vision penetrates 
        several hazy miles, toward the indistinct gray mass of central Lima. "That 
        sprawling, vigorous rash, that decaying <i>mestizo</i> boil on the skin 
        of Peru down there was engendered in rape."</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ernest 
        Brewer, exhibit designer, back muscles tensing, squirms against the plush 
        sofa pillow. <i>This brash young entrepreneur is a bit too crude for my 
        taste. Yet Howard Casper seems to know exactly what he wants and how to 
        get it. Disconcerting. Like back in New York museums those Ph.D.s in their 
        twenties and early thirties gaining reputations and positions beyond my 
        dreams and desires.</i> He rubs his short brown beard. Wonders if this 
        morning he had detected and thus managed to clip all of that recently 
        increasing crop of white hairs. <i>I'm only forty-two.</i></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Peru 
        is a land of victims." Another smile. "They don't even properly exploit 
        their own resources. We will prevail with our daring deeds." The entrepreneur 
        smiles again. "We're all rapists of sorts. Who among us is pure enough 
        to deny it!"</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ernest 
        Brewer, leaving his clipboard behind, approaches the picture window. Squinting 
        and adjusting his view left and right, he blends the grainy foreground 
        streaks into his own subtle, well-composed gray cityscape. Howard is saying 
        that Lima is the brains and balls of Peru.<br>

        gross</i>, Ernie thinks. <i>Too high-pressure even for the modern museum 
        world that has evolved over the last decade. Best available museum people 
        in their fields, Howard must be thinking. Each with his expertise and 
        weakness and price.</i></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Howard 
        is saying that all effective action, especially here in Peru, results 
        from a trade-off between idealism and imperfect means. "Peru has been 
        afflicted with more than its share of evil," he says. "All of us are good 
        guys, but morality and practicality have to be kept in an operable balance."</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why 
        victims," says Ernie from the window, breaking into a Howard Casper monologue 
        he has not been following, distracted by the memory of the flag-waving, 
        chanting demonstrators he saw through his rolled up taxi window this morning 
        on his way from the airport. He has no idea what they were protesting.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They're 
        losers," says Franklin O'Rourke, the young, dark-haired American anthropologist, 
        from his easy chair. "Even before Pizarro arrived, Spanish smallpox had 
        spread south killing the Inca and his court in Quito, leading to civil 
        war between Atahualpa and his half brother Huascar. That's how a middle-aged 
        Pizarro could defeat the Incas."</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now 
        don't get me wrong," says tall, slim, blond, young, Howard Casper, taking 
        off his tan suit jacket and folding it neatly on a chair. "I love Peru, 
        I really do. But their heroes are all defeated men. They're losers, like 
        Dr. O'Rourke says."</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Call 
        me Frank," says Dr. O'Rourke, "I'm not proud."</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We're 
        all doctors here in Peru, Frank. Even those with only pretensions to be 
        so."</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Part 
        of it is that they stab each other in the back," says the white-haired 
        man in the lone, straight-backed chair. "I've been in and out of this 
        country dozens of times in my fifty-year career and I can tell you there 
        isn't one of them wouldn't sell his grandmother's mummy if he had the 
        chance."</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Janus," 
        says Howard, "isn't that a bit strong?"</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Call 
        me <i>Doctor</i>, I'm proud," booms Janus Bodkin.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well 
        anyway," says Howard, "if rape is inevitable, relax and enjoy it." He 
        laughs.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Franklin 
        O'Rourke also laughs. Ernie Brewer smiles, the inevitable polite compromise 
        with discomfort.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's 
        human nature to exploit available opportunities," says Howard. "And if 
        this trip wasn't potentially profitable none of us would be here. I'm 
        good at exciting other people's imagination," he continues nonstop, "organizing 
        other people's talents and manipulating other people's money. Not for 
        nothing was one of my business courses called, 'Principal Practices'; 
        we called it 'Practical Pimping.' Rape, riches, and renown. Conquistadors 
        didn't care how they achieved it, but nowadays nobody does things like 
        that even if some lands seem just waiting to be reaped and raped of their 
        charms."</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Howard 
        pauses, smiles. Obviously unable to resist, he continues the thought. 
        "Who's to say it's rape and not seduction by the rapee? Sometimes they 
        just ask for it-flutter their eyelids, sidle up to you and say, 'come 
        on, it'll be good for both of us, exploit my resources.' A woman or a 
        country can't enter into a business transaction and afterwards cry rape! 
        How do you define rape anyway? Can a prostitute be raped?"</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Howard 
        looks indulgently at the expressions on the faces of his audience. "Nowadays 
        we're more sophisticated, and really, what's good for our project is good 
        for Peru. Don't take it so seriously, folks. Rape is just a metaphor."</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Much 
        more sophisticated ways of screwing the world's foremost Peruvianist," 
        says Dr. Bodkin, pulling a small, black-framed, folding magnifying glass 
        from a worn leather pouch.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now, 
        Janus, you promised to cooperate," Howard snarls politely. "Mutual advantages: 
        yours, mine, Peru's. Tolerate me."</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ernest 
        watches Dr. Bodkin squinting one-eyed through the magnifier at a small 
        faded brown tatter of cloth, his lips counting silently.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Howard 
        picks up a document. "Official description of our mission." He reads, 
        "Investigations leading to important anthropological discoveries and research 
        regarding the national patrimony, with the purpose of exhibiting materials 
        relevant to the cultural and aesthetic importance of the national heritage. 
        New Treasures of the Peruvian Highlands, Coast, and Jungle. Listen to 
        this," he continues. "We have commitments to travel the material to Munich, 
        London, Toronto, Los Angeles, Tokyo."</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ernie 
        Brewer returns to the sofa and looks at the clipboard Howard had given 
        him. "PAN-PERUVIAN EXPEDITION" on the metal clasp in transfer letters, 
        not quite evenly spaced, nor in a straight line. His grant contract with 
        the letterhead of the <i>Instituto Nacional de Cultura</i>-the bottom 
        half a profusion of red, blue, and black official stamps and signatures.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He 
        thumbs through the brochure Howard wrote and produced <i>"Peru's Treasures-Major 
        Expeditions-A Major Exhibition."</i> Photos of Howard in pinstripe behind 
        an executive's desk signing documents, Howard with Peruvian dignitaries, 
        pointing toward infinite horizons. Pages describing proposed expeditions 
        and permanent exhibits. A one-sentence description of each participant, 
        each name, including Ernest's, preceded by "Dr.," just as his photo I.D. 
        says "Dr. Ernest Brewer, Exhibit Design Specialist." <i>Doctor this and 
        doctor that</i>. The lone woman is described as "Scenarist/Coordinator," 
        and Howard with his masters degree in museology and in international business 
        practices, has the project title of "Facilitator."</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A 
        sharp rap on the door and in strides a movie star, curly blond hair, deep 
        tan, square jaw, wearing a brilliant white shirt open to his navel, sports 
        jacket hung by the hook of a finger over his shoulder. Jeffrey Fortune, 
        Amazonian ethnologist, shakes everyone's hands in a forceful grip.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well," 
        says Howard. "Now all that's missing is Dr. Agosto Felipe Peralta-Pardo, 
        our self-proclaimed Marxist from the National Institute of Culture, and 
        Darci Denby, our exhibits coordinator. She's a good catalyst, effecting 
        change, affecting other people, serenely untouched herself." Howard smiles. 
        "A woman after my own heart."</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ernest 
        wonders what kind of problems having a woman along will entail. He remembers 
        what Margaret had done when they had their argument the week before he 
        had come to Peru. His New Guinea mask ripped to pieces, Ashante doll dismembered, 
        Mexican ceramics now shards in a shoebox, the early Peruvian textile a 
        fragment of burnt threads. <i>She had never understood my love of art, 
        </i>he thinks<i>. We hang on out of-what?-habit, fear, residual affection. 
        I'm weak.</i></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
        door swings open again and Peralta-Pardo enters, swarthy, looking like 
        Ricardo Montelban, smiling his two even rows of <i>perlas blancas</i>.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Darci 
        Denby enters next, in plaid blouse and blue jeans, shoulder-length light 
        brown hair, slight-of-build yet feminine, with natural grace and seeming, 
        to Ernie, by her delicate, soft and pretty face, adolescent body, her 
        casualness, to contain an inkling of possibilities. <i>But of course</i>, 
        he thinks,<i> that's impossible, she'll be committed to someone else, 
        wouldn't find me attractive and turn out to be another emotional oddball</i>. 
        A fantasy never to be tested (he does not even wonder now if she is much 
        younger than he).</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She 
        seems a bit nervous and sits on the sofa. Peralta-Pardo sits between her 
        and Ernest.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Howard 
        clears his throat. "At great expense," he says, reciting his pre-arranged 
        speech, "the Council for Cultural Interchange, which administers the Educational 
        Alliance Trust, funded by Interplex and various other monies, has brought 
        you to Lima." For Howard, cash flow problems are merely a temporary annoyance. 
        "Remember what Pizarro said on his way toward victory: 'There lies Peru 
        with its riches. For my part, I go to the south.'"</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Within 
        a few years," says Janus Bodkin, "the conqueror of Peru was assassinated 
        by his former buddies."</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing 
        ventured, nothing gained," says Howard.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Howard 
        talks about the highlands. How Franklin as archeologist in charge will 
        penetrate the Vilcabamba area near Machu Picchu and how they will find 
        Inca gold. Howard explains that he has a map he got from a major collector 
        who got it from a grave robber. Janus Bodkin growls that anthropology, 
        "just ain't that goddamn simple." Howard explains that he has merely been 
        applying his favorite Murphy's Law: "An easily understood, workable falsehood 
        is more useful than a complex incomprehensible truth." Howard talks of 
        the coast. "Dr. Bodkin's found some interesting old hunks of cloth."</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hunks 
        of cloth!" explodes Janus Bodkin, looking up from his cloth fragment. 
        "Just the biggest Paracas Culture textile deposit since Julio C. Tello 
        unearthed the 'Necropolis'. Nay, it's bigger, better! Goddammit, nobody's 
        taking it away from me. Nobody's going to spill the beans before I excavate, 
        study, and publish!" Dr. Bodkin shakes a finger at Howard, his face reddens, 
        white hair and white mustache gleaming. "If you spill the beans, if you 
        upset my applecart, I'll thrash every ounce of flesh off your skinny bones. 
        And my project comes first."</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can't, 
        Janus. Everything's inked in on the calendar. Truck, horses, bearers in 
        the mountains, publicity, INC-approved schedule. We take the Inca gold-the 
        easy, spectacular stuff first. Then they can't hassle us on the illegal 
        digs."</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Got 
        to be me first. Damn Peruvian airforce'll see that dome in the desert 
        and spill my beans."</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No 
        choice in the matter. Think of it this way. Gold's the seduction and foreplay. 
        Withhold immediate gratification to arouse the woman. What civilization's 
        all about, right? Besides, the INC knows about your so-called 'test pit.' 
        If you hadn't begun excavation without permits you wouldn't have dug yourself 
        into a hole." He sniggers. "Pardo's as interested in our success as you 
        are."</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I 
        told you I don't trust that Peruvian. He'll double cross me and steal 
        my glory. He'd sell his grandmother's mummy."</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Howard 
        and Janus Bodkin speak as though Peralta-Pardo is not in the room. Pardo 
        does not look at them.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't 
        worry," says Howard. "He won't spill the<i> garbonzos</i>."</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bullshit," 
        says Bodkin. "I shall not be bamboozled."</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Janus, 
        I'm glad you don't write the way you talk."</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ernie 
        looks at his grant contract again. Wonders if he had been right to let 
        Margaret goad him into this trip. "If you don't take a chance," she'd 
        said, "what kind of man are you?" He writes on a ruled pad. </font></p>

        introduces Dr. Jeffrey Fortune, who wears the same kind of pre-faded, 
        tailored blue jeans as Franklin and even Janus Bodkin. Ernest wonders 
        if it is the anthropological uniform. In slacks, sports jacket and tie, 
        he feels an uneasy kinship with Howard in his suit.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jeffrey 
        talks of the Amazon. Ernie Brewer imagines heat, sweat, insects, turbulent 
        waters, smothering vegetation, and no decent artwork to compensate for 
        the discomfort and dangers.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jeffrey 
        talks of his recent interest in body decoration, and pulling open his 
        unbuttoned shirt reveals a tanned, hairless chest covered by a green and 
        red tattoo of sinuous leafy vines curled around each nipple and co-mingling 
        on his muscular stomach in a thick mass, disappearing below his belt. 
        "Amazonians use their bodies as an art form," says Jeffrey, "applying 
        red <i>achiote</i> paste in wild concentrations of design and color."</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I've 
        been wondering," Ernie Brewer says, "what Amazonian artworks we could 
        possibly show in our exhibit. If they'd give us some mounted torsos as 
        colorful as yours, maybe we'd have something."</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Some 
        cultures manifest their artistic impulse through dance, music, bodily 
        adornment, customs-aspects that can't easily be seen and appreciated by 
        the mere museum eye," says Jeffrey, stuffing shirt back in pants. "Masterpieces 
        to put on a pedestal and hang on the wall there aren't. But that's a problem 
        of your limited way of thinking about art."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Darci, listening to the others 
        arguing "pure esthetics" versus "cultural context," appears bored. "That's 
        my job to figure out later," she says. "I can take diverse yet related 
        parts, span the gap between disciplines and ideas, and bring them together 
        into a coherent whole. It's easy," she says. "I'm free of the factual 
        and emotional ties that inhibit specialists." She shrugs.</font><strong>

        just at this moment Peralta-Pardo hands her a piece of paper, his name 
        embossed on top. Ernest peeks unobtrusively and reads, 'I would very much 
        like to make passionate, violent love to you.' She writes, 'Some other 
        time,' across his writing and returns it. She goes into the bedroom and 
        softly shuts the door.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sex 
        is in the air," says Janus Bodkin, eyeing Peralta-Pardo. "As always."</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lust," 
        says Franklin. "I brought a gross of condoms on this trip. Know why women 
        have pussies?" Pauses. "So men will talk to them. Ha, ha," he says.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Never 
        use condoms," says Jeffrey Fortune. "You have got to have skin against 
        skin."</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sex," 
        says Peralta-Pardo, stating quietly, yet dramatically. "One could say 
        that rape is the envious response of the waning middle-aged toward the 
        perceived vitality of unattainable commodities. Of course, I, as a pure 
        Spanish blood in this Indian land, do not exempt myself."</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pardo 
        continues more forcefully. "You are here with your approved documents, 
        ready to begin another legal rape. This scientific intrusion by foreign 
        entities, this modern colonialism so subtle you may not even be conscious 
        of it yourselves. Peru, a land of great potential, of great accomplishment, 
        of heroes betrayed and worlds lost; beset by conquerors, exploiters, excavators, 
        users; ravaged, ravished. First the Spanish-at least they were straightforward 
        about it. Then the English. Now American multi-nationals running out of 
        campos to conquer. To say nothing of Peruvians doing it to Peruvians, 
        incestuously, brother to brother, spilling our seed into non-fertile ground 
        and going blind and mad."</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His 
        voice rises. "All Americans are multi-nationals," he says. "You people 
        don't seem to have come from anywhere." He stares at them. "I cannot specify 
        you. You are homogenized and I cannot taste any distinctive juice. Faceless 
        multi-nationals avoid the moral constraints of traditional social orders."</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Agosto!" 
        laughs Howard. "A fine way for a Communist to talk! What you have to realize 
        is that money like art is not really ours to own-we're only its temporary 
        custodians."</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peralta-Pardo 
        ignores Howard. "Tourists, professional observers, classifiers, exhibitors, 
        thieves of our past and present vitality. Peru needs a national chastity 
        belt."</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Howard 
        smiles his most diplomatic, conciliatory smile. "I like you, Agosto. You're 
        ballsy. But must self-serving acts, per se, diminish someone else?" He 
        sits back, fingertips of one hand flexing against those of the other, 
        like a spider reflected in a mirror.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Peru 
        is ignorant," says Peralta-Pardo, "but not stupid."</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ernest 
        wants to say that art is pure and his love of art is pure and he is addicted 
        to it, but he does not want to start an argument. He wonders if he should 
        leave the art museum in New York and switch to natural history. He wonders 
        how he would like dealing with bugs and birds and furry little things. 
        Would he get to work on anthropology exhibits? "I'm not political or here 
        to exploit," says Ernest, who finds politics boring. "I'm a designer. 
        I interpret information from experts and create the vehicle that provides 
        maximum understanding and comprehension. This project is concerned with 
        eternal values, with art. Not politics."</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peralta-Pardo 
        speaks ever so softly. "The poor cannot afford your luxury of art when 
        they need your money for bread. Your statement <i>is</i> political." He 
        smiles. "Where there are primitive art lovers, there are anthropologists, 
        where there are anthropologists, there are collectors. As you say in English, 
        they hold hands. They copulate with each other, and collaboratively with 
        the supine body of Peru."</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Designers 
        in museums," says Franklin, "just frame other peoples' masterpieces."</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>&nbsp;</i>"<i>De 
        mi punto de vista</i>," says Peralta-Pardo, "Peru's masterpieces should 
        not be excavated now. Or let Peruvians do it. But then I am not the minister 
        in charge any more. Internal politics. But there reside in me conflicts. 
        We require your money, so we sell our past for bread. You give petrodollars 
        to possess what we have and your country lacks-the tradition and vigor 
        of our arts."</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We're 
        neutral," says Howard. "Are we not to spend our tourist dollars, not help 
        you with scientific investigation? When your country needs investment 
        and technological aid and asks for it are other countries to say no to 
        mutually agreed-upon contracts?"</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peralta-Pardo 
        rises, goes to the door, opens it, steps out, and before closing the door 
        behind him, leans back and whispers, "Exactly."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entrepreneur mixes a cocktail 
        shaker full of <i>pisco</i>, lemon juice, sugar, ice, and a dash of powder, 
        shakes vigorously, pours greenish-white foam into small wine glasses, 
        sprinkles cinnamon powder on each. From the hard line of his jaws, the 
        trim, slick surface of his face shifts upward and forms, from some hidden 
        recess, narrow creases at the corners of his mouth. He distributes the 
        <i>pisco</i> sours and raises his glass. "No sweat," he says in his most 
        nonchalant manner.</font></p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;San Isidro pension. Howard has 
      brought them all by city bus from the Miraflores high rise suite he described 
      as a one-night-stand to impress Peralta-Pardo, "and other interested parties." 
      Ernest at night propped up in bed. He expects to have extraordinary esthetic 
      experiences and to use Peru in an article on exhibit-making and for a chapter 
      of a work in progress he has tentatively titled, "Contemplative Encounter 
      With Primitive Art." He writes his journal. 
      <p></p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Dear Diary: Day one. Peru. 
      </i><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Well I've certainly gotten 
      away from it all.</i>&nbsp; 
      <p></p>
      </font> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will 
        he be pressured to design the exhibit to emphasize art or archeological 
        context? What about political pressures? Peralta-Pardo's words have disturbed 
        him. He has always felt a twinge of guilt about owning even minor artifacts. 
        Now he cannot avoid the conflict between conscience and desire. How can 
        he buy some good pre-Columbian pieces? Would he still be able to rationalize 
        it?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He 
        writes about their pension that looks like a motel anywhere in the world, 
        like the hotel suite and the Lima airport.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He 
        notes that Darci shares a room with the entrepreneur. He wonders if she 
        knows Howard's attitudes toward women. "When a man wants something," Howard 
        had said, Pardo gone, Darci in the hotel suite bedroom, "he wants it now. 
        It's having to wait an hour or half or quarter till the woman lets him 
        that's worst. They call it civilization. Putting off satisfactions until 
        other people get theirs. Why do you think men hate women? When a real 
        man thinks he can get away with it he plunders. He goes for it. As always," 
        Howard had added, "I exaggerate a bit."</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later 
        at the pension: "I've just got to tell someone," Darci had whispered to 
        Ernest as they trailed behind the others going upstairs to bed. "Promise 
        you'll keep your mouth shut. One of those pigs tried to rape me. God, 
        was that intense."</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ernest 
        knows that many feminist books claim rape is not a sexual act but only 
        one of hostility and power. Howard had said, "Men are endowed with undifferentiated 
        lust, but we don't all rape." <i>Rape is a sexual act</i>, Ernest thinks. 
        He knows it is a commonplace fantasy. <i>What's acceptable fantasy</i>, 
        Ernest thinks, <i>is quite different from reality</i>. He wonders if right 
        now Darci and Howard are making love. He shakes his head. He can almost 
        understand people's recent interest in androgyny.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Putting 
        down his journal, he loosens his pajama bottoms and opens his Portuguese 
        language edition of Playboy. He hardly thinks at all of Darci Denby. He 
        wants to survive this trip with the minimum of complications that dealing 
        with other people inevitably causes. <i>Why'd she choose me to tell? How 
        can she keep so cool? "Rape is the only honest commerce." It sounds so 
        cynical, and so profound. But what do the words really mean? If I can 
        understand that, maybe I could decide if it were true. </i></font></p></td>
