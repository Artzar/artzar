            beings have always been fascinated with shadows. We have endowed them 
            with magic powers, given them personalities, romanticized them, and 
            credited them with the beginning of Art. Pliny tells us that portraiture 
            began when Korinthia, daughter of Debutades the potter, outlined the 
            shadow of her lover as the sun cast it on a wall in order to keep 
            his likeness. Romantic though it may be, we know that shadows of animals 
            painted on prehistoric cave walls were man’s first attempts at graphic 
            art. A shadow of a person, animal, or everyday object will evoke the 
            idea of that person or animal quickly in the viewer’s mind because 
            it is the least amount of information the brain needs to recognize 
            a pattern.</font></td>

            generally referenced as a form of portraiture, but also used as a 
            term for any specific black shape. The word &quot;silhouette&quot; 
            comes from a tightfisted French Minister of Finance, Etienne de Silhouette 
            (1709-69) whose hobby was cutting black paper profiles. The French 
            took their revenge on M. Silhouette for his cheapness by derisively 
            applying his name to anything reduced to its cheapest minimum. Inexpensive 
            trousers without pockets were called &quot;al&aacute; silhouette.&quot;</font></td>

            Silhouette did not invent the pastime. Shadow portraits had been a 
            hobby of the nobility and landed gentry for some years before his 
            birth. Alexandre Dumas described Queen Catherine cutting profiles 
            of her courtiers in La Dame de Monsoreau. Cutting and trading profiles 
            was analogous to people taking snapshots of friends and family with 
            their Kodaks early in the 20th Century. Commonly called &quot;shades&quot; 
            or &quot;profiles,&quot; the activity was generally restricted to 
            the upper classes who could afford the necessary paper and scissors 
            and had the time for such activities. Amateur cutters included Josiah 
            Wedgwood and Princess Elizabeth, daughter of George III. Professional 
            instructors often gave lessons in profile art to the children of the 
            nobility. The earliest recorded English cut paper portrait silhouettes 
            are those of monarchs William and Mary in 1699 by Mrs. Elizabeth Pyberg 
            who is believed to have been Dutch.</font></td>

            changed from a simple pastime of the well-to-do to something more 
            serious by the 1776 publication of <i>Essays on Physiognomy calculated 
            to extend the Knowledge and Love of Mankind</i>. Written by Johann 
            Caspar Lavater (1741-1801), a Swiss clergyman, the book described 
            a simple thesis in great detail: one could read a person’s character 
            by their profile. The book was aimed at those who could afford to 
            buy it: the nobility and landed gentry, the educated upper classes. 
            Lavater gave these people &quot;scientific&quot; proof of what they’d 
            known all along: that they were superior to the lower classes. All 
            worthwhile qualities could be found in the profiles of the upper classes 
            while venality and vice, sloth and drunkenness were found plentiful 
            in the profiles of the lower classes. As may be expected, Lavater’s 
            book was wildly popular. Translated into several languages it went 
            though 150 editions in twenty years. Lavater’s theory was popular 
            not for believers to see what others had in their faces, but to validate 
            what the upper classes knew to be true about themselves.</font></td>

            grew in popularity professional artists, quick to spot a trend, turned 
            to profile art. Soon every large city and resort had a number of professionals 
            plying their trade. At least 30 working between 1780 and 1820 were 
            skilled miniaturists in monochrome who produced hundreds of striking 
            painted silhouettes on plaster and ivory. Others, seeking a wider 
            audience, charged less and cut paper. A number of artists secured 
            Royal Patronage which also increased the popularity of the silhouette 
            as a portrait genre.</font></td>

            paper so that four profiles could be created simultaneously, which 
            he sold for 8 cents. He went on to marry Peale’s white cook (who wouldn’t
