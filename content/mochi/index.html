              Mochi (pronounced &quot;Mokey&quot;) was born in Florence, Italy, 
              March 11, 1889 into an aristocratic family whose title went back 
              to 1639. As a child he cut small animals from paper, later described 
              by one writer as &quot;quite mature&quot; for a six-year-old. Two 
              years later his family began his formal training at the studio of 
              a painter. Acceptance to the Academy of Fine Arts in Florence followed 
              at age ten. Like so many other artists who sought to romanticize 
              their backgrounds, interviews of Mochi in the 1930s had him running 
              away from home at age 15, &quot;because he [his guardian] wanted 
              me to give up art. Since I was 10 I study at the Academia di Belli 
              Arti in Florence. No, I would not give it up. So I go to Berlin.&quot;</font>

            composition of a piece of thin tissue paper and then place that over 
            black paper. To cut the paper Mochi used a device of his own construction,

                  28, 1967. Mochi would be paid $1,000 per panel: a total of $14,000 
                  for the project. (By comparison, at that time a home could be 
                  purchased in Southern California for that amount.)</font></td>

                    was involved in cutting out the blossoms of the flowering 
                    tree in the background of one panel. Each one of the myriad 
                    of blooms would be different, he decided. Day after day the 
                    tedious task continued, rendering him edgy and exhausted. 
                    (Mochi would have been nearly 80 at this time. DA.) One evening, 
                    unable to sleep, he went upstairs to continue the work. They 
                    found him lying there in the morning. Subsequent diagnosis 
                    indicated a stroke. Mochi’s friends and family were distraught. 
                    What irony, his masterwork would never be finished. It seemed 
                    as though the gods conspired to chastise this presumptuous 
                    mortal. However, Mochi tenaciously began to improve, and he 
                    finished the work. In 1969, at the completion, the museum 
                    honored him with a great reception.&quot; </i></font></p>
