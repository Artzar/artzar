        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The most fascinating 
          and most telling feature of Rothko's later work, of which I predominantly 
          write, is that it has the ability to make people from every walk of 
          life think of entirely different things and to feel entirely different 
          emotions. Once someone is given free reign to know what they are <i>not</i> 
          searching for (literal images, shapes and thus associations with which 
          to read the pieces), emotion is created and they have the opportunity 
          to venture inside themselves and to <i>feel</i>&#130; unhindered, led 
          only by the simplicity and purity of his work. In doing this, viewers 
          bring forth all their joy, pleasure and fears, good experiences and 
          bad to discover the stillness or silence within the work and within 
          oneself. Rothko's work is like a souvenir one takes home from a trip 
          abroad allowing one to return to the moment of purchase and be flooded 
          with all of the memories of the trip (one's life).</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In a manifesto published 
          in 1935 Rothko states that art is an adventure into an unknown world 
          and that it is the job of the artist to make the viewer see art from 
          the artists point of view. Rothko held the idea that the simple is able 
          to express a complex thought and that a large picture space is able 
          to create a strong impact and flatness destroy an illusion and reveal 
          truth. He used art as a portrait of an idea and as the language of the 
          spirit, especially his own and that of his contemporaries in the inter-war 
          and post-war period. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At the very beginning of 
          Rothko's career, prior to his complete abstraction, he was involved 
          with various artistic discussion groups such as The Ten (1935) and The 
          Art of This Century group (1946)), in which they debated ways in which 
          to express their true Self and the various issues arising at those times. 
          Although he was a very social man, voluble and well read in his discussions 
          and opinions, Rothko never felt entirely at peace in the real world 
          where he soon tired of the criticisms and judgements of his contemporaries 
          and lost interest in the ability of words to express his ideas. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Amongst art circles in New 
          York in the 1930s there was a resurrection and renewed interest in ancient 
          myth and the parallel drawn between contemporary and the antique. Rothko 
          was always in search of the sober grandeur of ancient Greece from which 
          to create a framework to control his passions, to eliminate "all obstacle 
          between the painter and the idea, between the idea and observer". He 
          named memory, history and geometry as obstacles as they create generalizations 
          from which one can take out the "ghost of an idea, not the idea itself". 
          It is in the subsequent clarity and purity of the idea itself that Rothko 
          is able to move the viewer to "understand" and not to rely upon explanations. 
          Standing before his painting was to follow Nicolas Calas's suggestion 
          that "One should listen to the stillness of painting with the awe with 
          which one listens to the silence of the desert and glaciers". In 1945 
          Rothko made the discovery of <i>light within the canvas itself</i>; 
          he had begun to use watercolour and watercolour paper and discovered 
          the different effects he could create. Perhaps it reminded Rothko of 
          the illusion of luminous light which the ancients imagined surrounding 
          gods when they returned to the earth. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This led Rothko, in the late 
          1940s, to Pompeii and to his last phase of painting. Rothko said it 
          was his wish to raise painting to a level that held the poignancy of 
          poetry and music. After his search for the silence of various time periods 
          and artists, he found it in the Pompeian frescoes and Greek and Roman 
          antiquities. Rothko's deep-seated need to control his own experience 
          of time, which he had always felt never fitted in conventional terms, 
          and his own &quot;Russianess&quot; and tendency to melancholic soul-searching 
          and moodiness, also led him to the works of Nietzsche. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Rothko had identified as 
          a young man with Nietzsche's own dissonance in being man and in needing 
          an illusion to hide the dissonance. Nietzsche's &quot;veil&quot; was 
          beauty and the return to Greek tragedy, which embodied both that dissonance 
          in being man and the beauty needed to hide it. Shakespeare too was to 
          soothe Rothko's own search for his destiny, and his exploration into 
          the disharmony of himself and mankind, especially after the Second World 
          War. In post-war Europe, a world very different from that in America, 
          art had retained a more refined vein. The Americans discovered that 
          even after all the breakthroughs they were making in their own country, 
          the main thinkers and critics were to be found in Europe where tradition 
          reigned. They thus followed developments in an attempt to erase, perhaps, 
          their feeling of slight inferiority when in comparison to the great 
          artists of the past who worked on the other side of the Atlantic.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">However, in France and other 
          parts of Europe, Rothko found a receptive and understanding audience 
          as the main thinkers and literati were exploring the very same themes 
          as those in America and, most importantly for Rothko, those he explored 
          himself. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Twenty years after Rothko 
          first began his exploration of Nietzsche, the French had resurrected 
          the great writer and his ideas. The search into the nature of space 
          and human drama and how man inhabits and interprets it was reflected 
          in Rothko's work. He brought with him the freedom and abandon of American 
          artists (considered by Newman to be barbarians&#130; in comparison to 
          European painters) who came "closer to the sources of tragic emotion". 
          In the Pompeian frescoes Rothko had found a mixture of calm, silence 
          and harmony for which the artists of the time were searching, influenced 
          by the ideas of Nietzsche. The faded colours on the Pompeian walls gave 
          testimony to the time which had passed, a vital measuring stick and 
          something consoling for Rothko. He had always associated art with the 
          drama of the theatre. The frescoes represented a backdrop for the theatre 
          of every day life that had taken place within the walls. Freed at this 
          point from the artistic circles in New York and the false sense of security 
          they gave to one another in their tight confines, Rothko finally found 
          <i>himself</i> and his discovery of the transcendental experience became 
          possible. In Europe they had understood in Rothko's paintings in Mallarm&eacute;'s 
          questioning of the void, the absence of all things, the idea of oneself 
          as the starting point of all things amidst nothingness. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Rothko was also deeply affected 
          by music in his search for solace and a connection with something greater 
          than mankind. Through music Rothko felt himself one with the universe, 
          that great void, no longer having to fight within the constraints of 
          the every day world and society. He found within himself the music and 
          himself within the music and was able later to capture on canvas that 
          complete harmony and distance from the dissonance of man. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Reading Nietzsche's first 
          book <i>The Birth of Tragedy (Out of the Spirit of Music)</i>, Rothko 
          associated himself with Nietzsche's Dionysian in whom the spirit of 
          music was felt and restored man to nature. Through his paintings Rothko 
          creates a much discussed universal language, like that of music, through 
          which, according to Nietzsche, the primal universe could speak through 
          the artist. Like musical interruptions, Rothko's use of brushstrokes 
          and colors are able to increase or decrease an atmosphere. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I believe that to enter 
          into the void that Rothko sets before one it is necessary to arm oneself 
          with one's obstacles. Once inside the peace and richness of his composition 
          and colors one can set them free. In so doing one sets oneself free 
          to roam and float in the realm of the pure idea and the peace of the 
          universe, speaking with the voices of those gone and those yet to come. 
          Those who stand before a Rothko are moved by forces unexplainable to 
          them and yet are so familiar. Through every thought, every smile, tear, 
          every wrinkle on the face, hair on their head, they will both add to 
          and detract from, the very essence of his painting. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Standing before these non-judgmental 
          works is like being in an empty court room without a jury, yet with 
          all the sense of being in an austere magisterial space and all it stands 
          for and all that has occurred within its walls; it is like taking part 
          in every fantasy one has ever imagined, like walking through a midnight 
          gallery completely naked and reveling in the secrecy and freedom in 
          being somewhere hallowed without an ounce of inhibition or guilt. Rothko 
          creates a world in which one can take all one's secrets, all impure 
          thoughts and wishes, all the words left unspoken. A universe where all 
          the actions left undone, all the regrets harbored, the tears not dared 
          shed, the smiles suppressed and all the joys experienced, to surface 
          and float within his colors on canvas. The dreams one dares to not make 
          reality and long for, the difference in life one may wish for, the unexpressed 
          Self, and all good intentions can be looked at as pieces of art in themselves, 
          one's own creations. His world is one where no one else can enter, judge, 
          comment upon or disturb. As the viewer gazes uninterrupted at the purity 
          and lucidity of his work, they can feel replenished and cleansed, uplifted 
          and inspired. His work seems to evoke every positive and negative image 
          within those who pass by; the colors seem to darken or lighten, the 
          shapes expand or contract under the influence of the spectators look 
          and thoughts. The very heart of his work is self-exploration and a deep 
          and entire understanding of himself and his destiny. </font></p>
