            <p> There were innumerable restatements of the laws during Hofmann&#8217;s 
              many years as a teacher. He was a legendary and archetypal teacher 
              and he seems to have painted the way he taught: generous, direct, 
              searching, uncompromising. He shared with his students the belief 
              that they had something, &#8220;a secret,&#8221; and that is what 
              they must paint. He painted his secret.</p>
            <p>In <a href="/content/letspaint/paintings/asklepios.jpg" target="_blank">Asklepios<img src="/content/letspaint/pop.gif" width="11" height="9" border="0"></a> 
              (Asklepios was the Greek god of healing) volcanic layers of blue, 
              red and purple appear. His brush drags the red paint down, over 
              and up creating an end zone for spindly shapes. The brush spins 
              over a little sunrise of yellow then drags down again. Patches of 
              exploding white and head like shapes create a base. All the unfamiliar 
              markings and figures hold their places, vibrate, and tremble. Something 
              is occurring.</p>
            <p>Painting is about feeling deeply and Hofmann felt deeply about 
              the language of painting and its ability to transform. The painter 
              can&#8217;t imitate. Only God can make a tree. Attempting to &#8220;make&#8221; 
              a tree, or anything else on canvas goes against the nature of painting. 
              Illusionistic realism doesn&#8217;t really do what painting needs 
              and wants to do. Painting wants to be alive and real in the sense 
              that fields and rivers and mountains and people are alive. </p>
