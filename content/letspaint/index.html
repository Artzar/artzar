            making a painting meant nothing less than recreating the world on 
            canvas and creating a new world&#8212;living, breathing, embraceable, 
            sustaining. For Hofmann, a painter could do this by trusting a few 
            fated ideas about what is necessary to make a painting. 
            <p>The painter creates form with color. Color is key. At the same 
              time, the artist has to compose in relation to the picture plane, 
              the magical, practical reality of the canvas as a two dimensional 
              but limitless field with four points and a surface. The painter 
              must also manipulate positive and negative space so that each carries 
              the value of the other. The painter must understand rhythm.</p>
            <p>But the painter had not only to employ these ideas. No, it was 
              much more than that. The painter paints him or her self. Hofmann 
              married this idea to the lessons and laws he distilled from the 
              masters, from C&eacute;zanne, the Cubists and Mondrian. For Hofmann, 
              painting required a complex of materials: nature, the medium, the 
              picture plane and the self. &quot;The artist&#8217;s technical problem,&quot; 
              wrote Hofmann, &quot;is how to transform the material with which 
              he works back into the sphere of the spirit.&quot; </p>
