      <p><b>How did you feel about receiving the American Book Award for </b><b><i>Life 
        Supports</i></b><b>?</b></p>
      <p>BRONK: That prize, so far as I was able to see, actually did nothing 
        for me. I went down to New York City to receive it. I’d never had that 
        kind of recognition before. The important thing is the work itself. I 
        take the satisfaction from <i>it</i>. I’m glad that somebody else can 
        discover the poems the way I discovered the poems. I’m glad that <i>Life 
        Supports</i> is back in print as well as <i>Vectors and Smoothable Curves</i>. 
        I have never sold well. <i>The World, the Worldless</i>, which was published 
        at a time when there was more of a literary public than there is today, 
        was reviewed in daily papers around the country. That would be out of 
        the question for a book of poetry now. It simply wouldn’t happen. When 
        I received the book prize I had a lot of newspaper people who wanted to 
        come talk to me. I said, &quot;Have you read the work?&quot; &quot;Oh 
        no, no,&quot; they said, &quot;but we know that you wrote certain things.&quot; 
        They wanted all sorts of personal information, which meant nothing to 
        them, really. And they would not have considered writing about their experience 
        with the work because in that case they’d have to <i>read </i>the work. 
        I think it’s proper for somebody else to write about a writer if he says 
        <i>this is my experience</i> of the writer. In which case he’s writing 
        about himself. And I think that’s perfectly legitimate. Read the writing 
        and write about the writing. Ignore the author.</p>
      <p><b>But if you’re really interested in someone’s work, aren’t you also 
        interested in their life?</b></p>
      <p>BRONK: A necessary aspect of biography is that it’s mistaken. It has 
        all sorts of wrong information. It’s unavoidable, maybe, maybe not, I 
        don’t know. My friend John Earnest, who knows my feeling about biographies, 
        wants to write a &quot;biography&quot; of the poems. He isn’t quite sure 
        what that means, and I said I’m not either, but it sounds like a good 
        idea.</p>
      <p><b>I like the human element. The stories.</b></p>
      <p>BRONK: Well, that’s what I’ve been doing lately, the other way around, 
        with the man who’s cataloging my art collection. He teaches art history 
        at the local college. He’s having me describe the works and get the facts 
        down about them. The circumstances when I acquired them, who the artists 
        were, that kind of thing. Discussing a piece brings back a lot of memories.</p>
      <p><b>You say, </b>&quot;<b>Don’t look to Olympus, nobody’s there.</b>&quot;</p>
      <p>BRONK: Olympus was the house of the gods. As far as <i>personalities</i> 
        are concerned, there are no gods. There may be a god but it isn’t in the 
        form of a person. It’s an abstract idea. It’s the traditional Jewish belief 
        that god doesn’t even have a name. It’s unspeakable.</p>
      <p><b>If, as you write, </b>&quot;<b>All worlds are temporary,</b>&quot;<b> 
        is anything permanent?</b></p>
      <p>BRONK: Yeah. I think there is permanence. It’s not worldly but that nevertheless 
        we are living in. We’re living in a very precise location. Hudson Falls, 
        New York or Binghamton, New York or wherever in the last years of the 
        twentieth century. Those things seem important to us. But somebody from 
        Sumner or Thebes or Babylon felt the same way; that they were in a very 
        distinct time and place. But those worlds are all gone. And presumably 
        ours will go also.</p>
      <p><b>Everything’s relative?</b></p>
      <p>BRONK: What isn’t?</p>
      <p><b>What <i>is</i> the real world?</b></p>
      <p>BRONK: [laughs] How could you ask me what something inexpressible is? 
        I don’t know. I have a feeling that there is, somehow, somewhere, a reality, 
        and that, possibly, we are even in contact with it. All this business 
        about aliens and other civilizations…our own civilization is as relative 
        and temporal and foreign really as alien civilizations are. There may 
        be alien civilizations but we have no idea what they might be. I wouldn’t 
        be able to begin to make any description of a real world any more than 
        I could make visualization or a physicality of a god. Those are concepts 
        which are beyond our temporality and our relativism.</p>
      <p><img src="/content/bronk/graphics/cloud.gif" alt="The Cloud of Unknowing (Poem)" width="500" height="158"></p>
      <p><b>What is art?</b></p>
      <p>BRONK: I don’t know. [long pause] What I do. I expect. I hope. I intend. 
        No, I don’t intend. I hope, I hope.</p>
      <p><b>Do you believe, in any way, shape or form, in reincarnation?</b></p>
      <p>BRONK: No, I don’t. I don’t think that the terms life and death, as we 
        commonly use them, have much relation to what may be going on, really. 
        I’m not sure that we truly have an incarnation let alone a reincarnation. 
        Incarnation is as mystical and immaterial as anything could be. If you 
        believe in reincarnation you pretty much have to believe that you’re leading 
        a real life, that you’re really alive. Which I find hard to believe. That 
        we live in those kind of hard terms. In the sense that we speak of the 
        computer world, there is a text of some kind that can be printed as a 
        hard copy but what comes out as hard copy is not a reality. A belief in 
        reincarnation says that there are material realities that get repeated, 
        that get restated in other terms. I don’t feel confident of that at all.</p>
      <p><b>Isn’t it said that energy is never lost but just changes form?</b></p>
      <p>BRONK: I know there’s a visible role that energy is never lost. That 
        doesn’t bother me one way or the other. I don’t think in the terms that 
        are commonly used. I use that language but it doesn’t necessarily mean 
        what other people mean by it.</p>
      <p><b>Do you think there are other intelligent life forms in the universe 
        other than on earth?</b></p>
      <p>BRONK: Not that I know of.</p>
      <p><b>Because of the size of the universe…the sheer number of planetary 
        systems…</b></p>
      <p>BRONK: I’ll read you a poem. &quot;We go looking through the universe 
        for someone other than us/We are other than us/Turn Hubbell here, look 
        at us/We are other than us.&quot; That is, we are other than the way we 
        speak and think of ourselves. We take ourselves for granted as an undeniable 
        reality. I have no quarrel with material evolution. Of course it happened. 
        We are created in a mortal form. The terms don’t interest me. Some people 
        are very satisfied with one story or another, of who we are and why. I 
        don’t find any such explanation satisfactory. And there’s no point in 
        arguing against it. If anybody wants to believe that, OK, but it does 
        not represent my experience. I can’t specify what I think as an argument 
        against what most people are thinking. But I feel quite certain that there 
        explanation is not correct. [imitating W.C. Fields] All right, give us 
        another one. I don’t have one to give. But I don’t accept someone else’s. 
        And that’s what I mean, &quot;We are other than us.&quot; We are other 
        than we are commonly spoken of. Let the Hubbell telescope turn around 
        and look at us and see if they can find something that they haven’t seen 
        before. The most recent statement is called For All We Know. &quot;Don’t 
        we know it all!/Everything/Language is what we lack/Neither the words 
        we have nor our syntax say certain things.&quot; But I have the feeling 
        that, yeah, we may very well know it all. Everything. We just simply can’t 
        articulate it. Have no way to say it in comprehensible language but I 
        think possibly we actually know it.<b> </b>Have you ever read Jab&#232;s?</p>
      <p><b>Yes. A little.</b></p>
      <p>BRONK: He’s engaged at a deep level but doesn’t have the kind of solidity 
        that Beckett has. Too much hors-d’oeuvre. Bits of highly flavored food 
        that never make a solid meal. And do you know a book called <i>The Cloud 
        of Unknowing</i>?</p>
      <p><b>I’ve heard of it.</b></p>
      <p>BRONK: 11<sup>th</sup> or 12<sup>th</sup> century.</p>
      <p><b>Mystical Catholic thing?</b></p>
      <p>BRONK: Yeah. Apparently he was a monastic figure. Nobody knows exactly 
        who he is. But it is, very definitely, even though it was written in the 
        11<sup>th</sup> or 12<sup>th</sup> centuries, a 20<sup>th</sup> century 
        book. A great deal of which I wrote, actually. When I read it I’d find 
        whole paragraphs, hey, I wrote this!</p>
      <p><b>There’s a big mind transmitter somewhere, I don’t know.</b></p>
      <p>BRONK: The whole point of <i>The Cloud of Unknowing</i> is that there 
        is a great view of reality which we simply cannot formulate. And he doesn’t 
        make any attempt to formulate it. Which is, I think, pretty much what 
        I do. My writing is not so much about what I know as about what we don’t 
        know. And what is unknowable.</p>
