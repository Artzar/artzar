      <p><b>Is this house like a second skin to you?</b> </p>
      <p>BRONK: Not only skin, it has internal organs. It’s the only place that’s 
        ever been home. I’ve lived outside of it from time to time when I was 
        in college, briefly in New York City and the service, but it’s the only 
        place that I have ever really felt at home in. I wasn’t really comfortable 
        anywhere else.</p>
      <p><b>It’s been such a core part of your writing.</b></p>
      <p>BRONK: Oh yeah. The house is a frequent metaphor with me. I think very 
        likely that when I die it will be torn down. It has a two-wire electrical 
        system. It’s inadequately insulated. The plumbing is old. No modern person 
        would put up with it.</p>
      <p><b>You’ve lived here alone for many years now, haven’t you?</b></p>
      <p>BRONK: I think most people’s lives are pretty solitary. Even people who 
        go to offices or factories where there are lots of other people. I remember 
        a woman I would have said had lived a great deal of her life in a quite 
        satisfactory marriage, had several children. Her husband died, and I was 
        commiserating with her. She said, &quot;I’ve always been alone.&quot; 
        And I was surprised but the more I thought about it, the more I thought, 
        yeah, she’s one of the few honest people in the world. And she certainly 
        was a woman that not only had that family. She had lots of friends and 
        was not a recluse at all. She was out every day, meeting people, enjoying 
        them. The woman from next door, whose children were grown, lost her husband, 
        but not too long after that she told me that she was going to marry a 
        man in Florida, whom she had grown up with and gone to school with here. 
        I said, &quot;Nothin’ like first love, is there.&quot; And she said, &quot;Who 
        the hell’s ever said anything about love. She said, I can’t live alone.&quot; 
        &quot;Oh,&quot; I said, &quot;I live alone.&quot; She says, &quot;The 
        hell you do. I don’t know anybody that has more people in his house than 
        you do!&quot; It was pretty much true at that time. There were a lot of 
        young people that were here most of the time, coming and going, you know. 
        But I was still living alone. I’ve always had close friends. I may not 
        have had as many casual friends as lots of people do but I think I’ve 
        more close friends than most people do.</p>
      <p><b>There’s an unusual stove in the kitchen.</b></p>
      <p>BRONK: That’s an Aga stove. There was a woman who came in through the 
        kitchen a couple of years ago and the first thing she said was, &quot;Oh, 
        you have an Aga stove!&quot; And I said, &quot;You’re familiar with Aga 
        stoves?&quot; And she said, &quot;Oh yes. I grew up with my grandmother 
        in Ireland and she had an Aga stove.&quot; They were a Swedish development 
        designed to be very economical in their burning of coal. They’re designed 
        to store up heat and not release it into the room. They are widely used 
        still today in England and the British Isles in general, Scotland, Ireland. 
        My father apparently saw them at a housewears show and decided he wanted 
        to sell them. He was a dealer but I don’t think that he ever sold very 
        many. Today they’re still made but made principally for burning gas rather 
        than coal, which of course would be much more convenient. To me it wouldn’t 
        be the same thing. I still use coal. A few years back there was publicity 
        about them again calling them a &quot;celebrity&quot; stove [laughs]. 
        I think they’re ten or eleven thousand dollars now. They are economical 
        but the initial cost is such that it’s not an easy sell. It was said that 
        Princess Diana had one. I forget who was listed in this country, maybe 
        Norman Mailer, I don’t know.</p>
      <p><b>When did you begin writing?</b></p>
      <p>BRONK: I began writing things in High School because of a teacher that 
        I had who had a great influence on me. She’s still alive, God bless her. 
        But what I was writing at that time were imitations of one person or another. 
        When I went to Dartmouth my teacher was Sidney Cox. I’m sure that I began 
        writing things for him that were poems and were mine.</p>
      <p><b>At that point did you know that you would follow that course and continue 
        to write seriously?</b></p>
      <p>BRONK: No, I didn’t know it, though it wouldn’t have surprised me. There 
        wasn’t conscious planning or a definite goal. It was simply something 
        was happening that I hoped might continue to happen. Writing is something 
        that <i>happens</i> to the writer. And if it doesn’t happen again to the 
        reader, you might as well not have read it. In either case it’s a happening. 
        Literature is about the reader's experience of the work. It’s the reader 
        that makes the work. Some people expect that the reading experience of 
        the work is going to be made for them. But, unless the reader really makes 
        the work, it might as well not be read. If it isn’t doing something to 
        the reader, it’s not authenticated.</p>
      <p><b>Are you a pencil and paper man when you work? Do you sit at the typewriter?</b></p>
      <p>BRONK: [holds up sheet of white paper bearing a few lines in his spidery 
        script] This was yesterday. I don’t know whether it’s finished or not. 
        I’m not making it any longer but I might need to rephrase something. I 
        hate to type. I’ve never really learned to use the typewriter. I don’t 
        hunt and peck anymore because I know pretty much where the keys are but 
        nevertheless I’m<i> watching</i>. It’s always by hand. Sometimes I hear 
        the whole thing before I even have a pencil or a pen in my hand. Back 
        in the days when I mowed the lawn a poem might happen while I was mowing. 
        It would have nothing to do with <i>mowing</i>. It would start working 
        in my head. That was the way also when I was walking. I tried to remember 
        to carry a stub of pencil with me. I could always pick up an old cigarette 
        package or something and jot some things down so I wouldn’t forget them 
        before the time I got home. Very often now I wake up at night in the middle 
        of a poem or wake up in the morning with something going on in my head 
        and I say, no, no, that’s not a poem. But it keeps insisting, you know, 
        look at me. I might get up, start shaving, whatever, and go, ah, ah go 
        back and get my workbook and write down a few lines. There’s no advanced 
        planning. It comes as a surprise. Oh, oh, is that so? [laughs] When I 
        was writing <i>The Brother in Elysium</i> I pretty much <i>had </i>to 
        plan, but I didn’t always know where I was going. As a matter of fact 
        I can remember I would come to a point at which I’d say to myself, Where 
        the hell do I go from here? And usually that would straighten itself out 
        when I’d be walking. I’d go for a walk in the afternoon and be somewhere 
        out in the countryside and realize, Oh, yeah, I know now. When I write 
        tomorrow I will do such and such. A sentence or a paragraph or a direction 
        would occur to me. It was a way to get away from the desk. I think we 
        have to get away from the desk and do something physical, otherwise we’re 
        in a trap that we don’t see our way out of. If you stay inside it you 
        can get lost. You have to re-approach it. It’s a matter of replenishing 
        your energy. Getting a fresh view of things.</p>
      <p><img src="/content/bronk/graphics/dictum.gif" alt="Dictum (Poem)" width="500" height="144"></p>
      <p><b>How much do you revise?</b></p>
      <p>BRONK: I revise very little. And the revisions are not really re-writings 
        at all. In most workshops and creative writing classes you’re advised 
        to re-write and re-write. If the poem isn’t there there’s no point in 
        trying to write it. And if the poem <i>is</i> there, leave it alone. Very 
        frequently I think that I’m improving something. I make the improvements 
        and then the next day realize that it was right the first time. Leave 
        it alone.</p>
      <p><b>Beckett said that his work was a matter of fundamental sounds.</b></p>
      <p>BRONK: Oh, yes. You have to hear it, very definitely yes. I wonder sometimes 
        when I’ve heard other poets read without any expression at all, with no 
        sense of how the words go together. I asked Creeley why he read that way, 
        &quot;Well, I didn’t want to con anybody,&quot; he said. &quot;I just 
        wanted to give’em the words.&quot; Which is like a piano player saying, 
        &quot;I didn’t want to con anybody, I just wanted to play the notes.&quot; 
        And when I hear somebody read that way I wonder what they heard when they 
        wrote the piece. Is <i>that</i> the way they heard it? I hear it in full 
        expression; this is the way these words should go together. Creeley’s 
        poetry became second-hand Bronk, very very much so. And I think he was 
        well aware of it. I have no idea what it is right now because I haven’t 
        seen anything recently.</p>
      <p><b>Did you know Charles Olson?</b></p>
      <p>BRONK: Olson came here one time looking for me but I wasn’t here and 
        I went to Black Mountain one time looking for him but he wasn’t there. 
        We had some correspondence. I admired the man but really didn’t care anything 
        for his poetry. In most cases I didn’t know what he was talking about. 
        I haven’t the slightest idea what &quot;projective verse&quot; is.</p>
      <p><b>How do you feel about giving poetry readings?</b></p>
      <p>BRONK: I like to read to a person or two or three here in the house. 
        It’s like having a conversation. Public readings are something else again. 
        I was never invited very often. In recent years I have been invited and 
        have refused because I don’t want to do it anymore. Success is awfully 
        hard to take. It’s corrupting. And we’re all, including me, corruptible.</p>
      <p><b>Are you familiar with the Internet, the World Wide Web?</b></p>
      <p>BRONK: I know there are such things. My archives at Columbia and the 
        University of New Hampshire are indexed on the Internet. From time to 
        time somebody will say to me, &quot;Oh, I saw one of your poems on the 
        Internet the other day.&quot; I don’t know who put it there or why.</p>
      <p><b>What writers do you admire?</b></p>
      <p>BRONK: I have a great admiration for Proust. I might say Shakespeare, 
        if there actually <i>was</i> a Shakespeare. I almost feel that Shakespeare 
        is inexpressible. I said, someplace or other, that Shakespeare didn’t 
        write the plays. They were part of the original creation. I greatly admired 
        Beckett for a number of years but I haven’t read anything of his recently 
        and wonder if I would still feel that way about him. I’m not sure. He 
        was a great excitement to me when I was reading <i>Molloy</i>, <i>Malone 
        Dies</i> and <i>The Unnamable</i>. And of course the plays, very fine. 
        I don’t read anything anymore except the New York Times, the New Yorker 
        and books that friends have written send me. I’m glad I read the things 
        I did when I was younger because I couldn’t possibly do it now. I read 
        Proust two or three times. Time is not a uniform quality because as you 
        get older it shrinks. I don’t know where the hell it goes to. There used 
        to be long days when you could read long books but they’re not there any 
        more.</p>
