      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This interview was excerpted 
        from several hours of taped conversations made during three visits to 
        William Bronk's home in Hudson Falls, New York in the fall of 1996. He 
        was suffering from respiratory problems and wed to an oxygen machine with 
        a lengthy cord. Bronk spoke slowly between long pauses and gasps of air. 
        When something reminded him of a poem, he'd boom it out in that unforgettable, 
        authoritative manner which gave his public readings (rare though they 
        were) such power.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> William Bronk was born in 
        Hudson Falls, New York in 1918. He is a descendent of Jonas Bronck, for 
        whom the Bronx is named. After attending Dartmouth College and serving 
        in World War II, he took charge of his family's business, the William 
        M. Bronk Coal and Lumber Company in Hudson Falls, which he ran until his 
        retirement in 1978. He lived in his family's spacious Victorian house 
        virtually his entire life. He never had a driver's license. His house 
        was a mecca for artists and poets.</font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> In 1951, Bronk published poems 
        in the journal Origin, edited by the poet Cid Corman. In 1956 Origin published 
        his first book of poems, <i>Light and Dark</i>. New Direction's published 
        his second book, <i>The World, the Worldless</i>, in 1964. He went on 
        to publish nearly thirty books and won the American Book Award in 1982 
        for his collected poems, <i>Life Supports</i>. Some of his more recent 
        work includes <i>Death Is the Place</i> (1989), <i>The Cage of Age</i> 
        (1996), <i>Manifest</i>; <i>And Furthermore</i> (1996) and <i>All of What 
        We Loved</i> (1998).</font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> In the essay, Native Son, 
        novelist/filmaker Paul Auster writes: "Bronk's is a poetry of extreme 
        positions. Ruthlessly solipsistic in outlook, plain of speech, and ranging 
        in tone from the most bitter irony to the most gentle lyricism, nearly 
        all his work revolves around a few essential problems and themes: the 
        rift between our image of the world and the reality of the world, the 
        force of desire, the agony of human relationships, our perception of nature." 
        Auster calls William Bronk and Samuel Beckett "spiritual brothers."</font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> William Bronk was 81 when 
        he passed away in February 1999. The New York Times called him "a poet 
        of depth and haunting vision." His final collection, <i>Metaphor of Trees 
        and Last Poems</i> (1999), was published posthumously by Talisman House. 
        Recent and forthcoming books on William Bronk include <i>The 'Winter Mind': 
        William Bronk and American Letters</i> (1998), by Burt Kimmelman and <i>Accumulating 
        Position: The Selected Letters of William Bronk</i>, edited by David Clippinger.<b>
